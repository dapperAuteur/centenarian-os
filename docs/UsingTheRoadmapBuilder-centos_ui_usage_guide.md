## The Planning Hierarchy Explained

Think of it like a map with zoom levels:

### üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap (Highest Level)
**What**: Your entire multi-decade journey
**Example**: "My Centenarian Journey (2025-2050)"
**When to use**: You'll only create 1-3 roadmaps total

### üéØ Goals (Multi-Year)
**What**: Audacious objectives that take years
**Example**: "Run a sub-17 second 100m dash"
**When to use**: Create 5-10 goals per roadmap (one per major life area)

### ü™ú Milestones (Quarterly/Monthly)
**What**: Measurable checkpoints toward a goal
**Example**: "Q4 2025: Consistent 18s 100m"
**When to use**: Create 4-12 milestones per goal (break the goal into smaller chunks)

### ‚úÖ Tasks (Daily)
**What**: Specific actions you do today
**Example**: "5:50 AM - Morning Strength Session"
**When to use**: Create tasks for the next 1-4 weeks

## Workflow: From Vision to Daily Action

### Sunday (Planning Day)
1. Review last week's task completion in **Planner** view
2. Go to **Roadmap** view
3. Check milestone progress
4. Create next week's tasks (7-14 tasks total)

### Monday-Friday (Execution Days)
1. Use **Daily Tasks** view only
2. Check off tasks as you complete them
3. Don't worry about the hierarchy

### Monthly
1. Review milestone status
2. Mark milestones as "Completed" when done
3. Create new milestones for next quarter

### Quarterly
1. Review goal progress
2. Adjust target years if needed
3. Archive completed goals

## Tips for Effective Planning

### For Goals
- Make them audacious (if it doesn't scare you, it's not a goal)
- 1-2 per life area max (don't spread yourself thin)
- Must be measurable ("be healthy" ‚ùå, "run sub-17s" ‚úÖ)

### For Milestones
- Use quarters: Q1 (Jan-Mar), Q2 (Apr-Jun), Q3 (Jul-Sep), Q4 (Oct-Dec)
- Include the metric in the title: "Hold 30s Front Lever" not "Get stronger"
- Mark as "Blocked" immediately if stuck (then troubleshoot)

### For Tasks
- Schedule same time each day (builds habits)
- Link to ONE milestone only
- Keep activity short (fits on task card)
- Put details in description (you'll expand card when needed)

## Navigation

### Two Views for Different Purposes

**Roadmap View** (`/dashboard/roadmap`)
- For planning and reviewing hierarchy
- Expand/collapse to see your entire journey
- Use on Sundays for weekly planning

**Daily Tasks View** (`/dashboard/planner`)
- For execution mode
- Only shows today's or this week's tasks
- Use Monday-Friday for getting work done

## Keyboard Shortcuts (Coming Soon)

Will add in Phase 2:
- `N` - New task (from anywhere)
- `Space` - Toggle task complete
- `E` - Edit task
- `T` - Switch to Today view
- `W` - Switch to Week view

## What's Next

Now that you have the planning system:
1. **This week**: Create your roadmap hierarchy
2. **Next week**: Use it daily and track in Planner view
3. **Phase 2**: We'll add the Fuel (nutrition) and Engine (focus tracking) modules

The system works best when you use it every day for at least 2 weeks before judging it.
