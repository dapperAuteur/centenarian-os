## **Slide 1: Congratulations! You Did It!**

**Script:**
"Welcome to Week 5! You made it to the end of our health tracking course. Look how far you've come!

Five weeks ago, you were just starting to learn about tracking your health. Now you know how to collect data, spot patterns, and use numbers to make smart health choices.

Let me tell you about Maria, a busy mom who started this course just like you. In Week 1, she felt confused by all her fitness tracker data. By Week 5, she had learned to track her sleep and steps. She discovered that when she got 7+ hours of sleep, she walked 2,000 more steps the next day! This simple discovery helped her sleep better and move more.

Today, we'll help you create your own health plan and get ready to keep improving your health for years to come."

**Key Points:**
- You've learned a lot in 5 weeks
- You can now use data to make health decisions
- Today we create your personal health plan

## **Slide 2: Looking Back at Your Health Journey**

**Script:**
"Let's look at how much you've improved since Week 1.

When you track your health over several weeks, you start to see bigger patterns. These patterns are more important than daily ups and downs.

For example:
- If your average sleep has gotten better over 4 weeks, that's a real improvement
- If you're walking more steps each week, you're building a healthy habit
- If your resting heart rate is slowly getting lower, your heart is getting stronger

Think of it like this: One bad night of sleep doesn't matter much. But sleeping better most nights for a month? That's a big win for your health."

**Activity:**
Compare your Week 1 numbers to your Week 5 numbers:
- Average sleep hours per night
- Average daily steps
- How often you exercised per week
- How you feel about your health (1-10 scale)

**Key Points:**
- Look at trends over weeks, not daily changes
- Small improvements add up over time
- You should see some positive changes from Week 1

---

## **Slide 3: Understanding Your Health Patterns**

**Script:**
"Now you know how to spot the difference between normal daily changes and real health trends.

**Normal Daily Changes (Don't Worry About These):**
- Some days you sleep less than others
- Your steps are higher on weekends than weekdays
- Your heart rate is different when you're stressed

**Real Health Trends (These Matter):**
- Your average sleep is improving over weeks
- You're consistently walking more than before
- Your energy levels are better most days

**When to Make Changes:**
- If a trend is going in the wrong direction for 2+ weeks
- If you're not making progress toward your health goals
- If something feels off and the data confirms it

**When to Be Patient:**
- Daily numbers go up and down (that's normal!)
- You just started a new habit (give it 2-3 weeks)
- You're recovering from being sick or stressed"

**Key Points:**
- Daily changes are normal
- Look for patterns over 2+ weeks
- Know when to adjust vs. when to wait

## **Slide 4: Creating Your Health Blueprint**

**Script:**
"Now it's time to create your personal Health Blueprint - a simple one-page plan for your future health.

Your Health Blueprint has four parts:

**Part 1: Your Top 3 Health Goals**
Write these in simple words:
- 'I want to sleep better'
- 'I want to exercise more'
- 'I want to feel less stressed'

**Part 2: Your Key Numbers to Track**
Pick 3-5 numbers that matter most:
- Hours of sleep per night
- Steps per day
- Exercise minutes per week
- How you feel (1-10 scale)

**Part 3: Your 90-Day Action Plan**
- Month 1: Start one new healthy habit
- Month 2: Make that habit stronger, add another
- Month 3: Keep both habits going, fine-tune them

**Part 4: Your 'Why' Statement**
Write why these goals matter to you:
- 'I want energy to play with my kids'
- 'I want to feel confident in my body'
- 'I want to stay healthy as I get older'"

**Key Points:**
- Keep it simple and personal
- Focus on 3-5 key numbers
- Have a clear reason why you want to improve

## **Slide 5: Making Smart Health Decisions**

**Script:**
"Here's a simple guide for when to adjust your health plan:

**If your numbers are improving:** Keep doing what you're doing!

**If your numbers are stuck for 2+ weeks:**
- Try a small change to your routine
- Ask for help from a friend or coach
- Check if something else is affecting your health (stress, work, etc.)

**If your numbers are getting worse:**
- Look for what changed in your life recently
- Go back to basics (focus on sleep and movement first)
- Consider if you need to see a doctor

**Simple Decision Rules:**
- One bad week = Don't worry, keep going
- Two bad weeks = Look for what might be wrong
- Three bad weeks = Time to make changes or get help

**Red Flags (See a Doctor):**
- Your resting heart rate suddenly goes up a lot
- You're sleeping much worse for no clear reason
- You feel much more tired even though your habits are good"

**Key Points:**
- Small changes work better than big ones
- Look for patterns, not daily ups and downs
- Know when to get professional help

## **Slide 6: Your 90-Day Health Action Plan**

**Script:**
"Let's create a realistic plan for the next 90 days:
