### **Post Idea 2: The Educational Thread (X/Twitter/Threads)**

This thread breaks down a core concept from the course, using the athletes as the proof point.

- **Post 1/5:** At 100, Lester Wright isn't just surviving; he's thriving, running the 100m dash in 26.34s. This level of vitality isn't an accident. It's the result of a strong foundation. But what is that foundation built on? 🧵
    
- **Post 2/5:** It's built on metrics. Simple numbers that tell the story of your health. Our "Foundations of Fitness" course focuses on 4 essential ones. First up: **Resting Heart Rate (RHR)**. A lower RHR is strongly linked to a longer life (JAMA). These athletes master recovery.
    
- **Post 3/5:** Next: **Daily Steps**. Forget the 10,000-step myth. Research from Harvard Medical School shows major benefits start around 7,000-8,000 steps. It's about consistent, daily movement—a non-negotiable for athletes like Ida Keeling, who started at 67.
    
- **Post 4/5:** These centenarians didn't have an Apple Watch, but they intuitively understood what the data now proves: consistent activity, quality rest, and listening to your body are the keys. They built their "Century Plan" without even knowing it.
    
- **Post 5/5:** We teach you how to build your own Century Plan with precision. Learn to use data to live a longer, stronger life. Our self-paced "Foundations of Fitness & Health Metrics" class starts 8/2. Join us. [Link] #HealthTech #Wearables #Longevity
