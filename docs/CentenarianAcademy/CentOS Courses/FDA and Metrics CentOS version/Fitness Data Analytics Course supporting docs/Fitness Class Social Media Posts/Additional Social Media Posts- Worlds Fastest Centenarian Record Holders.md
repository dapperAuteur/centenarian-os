🏃‍♂️ WORLD RECORD: 26.34 seconds at age 100

Lester Wright didn't just break the world record - he SHATTERED it.

The day after his 100th birthday, he ran the fastest 100-meter dash by any centenarian in history.

But here's what's really incredible:
✅ WWII veteran (Normandy, Battle of the Bulge)
✅ Previously held M75+ 200m world record at age 76
✅ Married to his high school sweetheart for 80+ years
✅ Runs 1.5 miles, 3x per week in his neighborhood
✅ Said the 100m felt "too short" - he prefers 200m & 400m

His secret? Lifelong commitment to movement and data-driven training.

This is why I'm obsessed with health metrics. The patterns that help Lester perform at 100 can help YOU optimize your health at ANY age.

My course "Foundations of Fitness and Health Metrics" teaches you to track and optimize like the champions do.

Launch: August 2nd. Comment "CHAMPION" for early access.

**Content**:
```
The world's fastest centenarian record has dropped by 16.66 seconds in just 20 years.

From 43 seconds (2002) to 26.34 seconds (2022).

That's a 38% performance improvement - at age 100+.

Here's what these record-breakers teach us about sustained performance:

🔹 EVERETT HOSACK (2002, ~43s)
- Started elite competition after retirement
- Leveraged public platforms (Jay Leno Show) for impact
- Proved age doesn't limit achievement potential

🔹 WALDO MCBURNEY (2003, 39.97s) 
- Career pivot: Beekeeper → World record athlete at 65
- Wrote autobiography at 102: "My First 100 Years"
- Demonstrated lifetime learning and adaptation

🔹 DONALD PELLMANN (2015, 26.99s)
- ROI on late-stage investment: Started competing at 70
- Multi-disciplinary excellence: 7 world records by age 90
- Strategic mindset: Targeted specific competitor's record

🔹 LESTER WRIGHT (2022, 26.34s)
- Consistent systems: 1.5 miles, 3x/week for decades
- Long-term partnerships: 80+ year marriage
- Continuous improvement: Previous M75+ record holder

The common thread? Data-driven health optimization and systematic training.

These aren't genetic anomalies - they're examples of what's possible with proper health metrics and consistent application.

In my upcoming course "Foundations of Fitness and Health Metrics," I teach the tracking systems that enable this level of sustained performance.

What performance metrics are you tracking in your life?

**Content**:
```
Performance improvement typically slows with age.

But centenarian 100m world records tell a different story:

📊 2002-2022 PROGRESSION:
→ 43.00s to 26.34s  
→ 38% improvement over 20 years
→ Average 1.9% annual improvement
→ At ages 100+

This isn't normal. It's exceptional.

WHAT CHANGED?

1️⃣ TRACKING SOPHISTICATION
Early 2000s: Basic stopwatches
2020s: Comprehensive health metrics, heart rate variability, sleep data

2️⃣ TRAINING SCIENCE
Better understanding of recovery, periodization, and personalization

3️⃣ COMMUNITY SUPPORT  
Masters athletics growth, better coaching, peer networks

4️⃣ MINDSET SHIFT
From "managing decline" to "optimizing performance"

The lesson for business and life:
→ What you measure improves
→ Small, consistent optimizations compound
→ Age is less limiting than we assume
→ The right systems enable extraordinary outcomes

My "Foundations of Fitness and Health Metrics" course teaches these optimization principles.

Because if it works at 100, imagine what it can do for you today.

**Visual**: Collage of all record holders with their times

**Caption**:
```
REALITY CHECK: These people are breaking world records at 100+ 🤯

While most people are worried about "getting old," these legends are asking:
"How fast can I run this decade?"

🏃‍♂️ Lester Wright: Turned 100, broke world record the next day
🏃‍♂️ Donald Pellmann: Started competing at 70, set 7 records at 90
🏃‍♂️ Waldo McBurney: Beekeeper until 106, author at 102
🏃‍♂️ Julia Hawkins: "Hurricane" - because hurricanes don't slow down

What they ALL have in common:
✅ Started tracking their health data early
✅ Consistent daily habits over decades
✅ Never accepted "age-appropriate" limitations
✅ Used data to optimize, not just track

The question isn't whether you'll age.
The question is: Will you age optimally?

Start tracking. Start optimizing. Start now.
