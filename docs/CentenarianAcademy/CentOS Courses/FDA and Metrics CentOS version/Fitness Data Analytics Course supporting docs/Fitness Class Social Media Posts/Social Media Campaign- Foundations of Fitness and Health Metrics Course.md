🏃‍♂️ GOAL: Sub-3-hour marathon at age 100

I'm Brand Anthony McDonald, and I'm not just dreaming about living to 100 - I'm training for it.

That's why I'm launching "Foundations of Fitness and Health Metrics" - a 5-week course that teaches you to:
✅ Track the 4 key health numbers that matter most
✅ Turn wearable device data into actionable insights  
✅ Make smarter daily health decisions
✅ Contribute to collaborative longevity science

Course launches August 2nd. Early access for my community starts soon.

### Day 2 (July 24): Educational Hook
**Platform**: TikTok + Instagram Reels
**Format**: 60-second educational video
**Hook**: "4 numbers that predict your lifespan"

**Media Idea**: 
- Text overlay revealing each metric with dramatic pauses
- Split screen: your face explaining + data visualizations
- End with course teaser

**Script**:
```
"Here are 4 numbers that can predict how long you'll live:

1. Resting heart rate [pause, show 52 BPM on screen]
2. Sleep efficiency percentage [pause, show 89%]
3. Daily step variance [pause, show graph]
4. Heart rate recovery time [pause, show 45 seconds]

Most people track these wrong or don't track them at all.

I'm Brand Anthony McDonald, training to be the World's Fastest Centenarian, and I've spent 5 years perfecting how to track these metrics properly.

I'm teaching everything in my new course launching August 2nd.

Comment METRICS for the free guide that breaks this down."
