## Page 1: What Are Health Metrics and Why They Matter

### What Are Health Metrics?

Health metrics are simple numbers that tell you how your body is doing. Think of them like grades on a report card, but for your health.

Your phone already tracks steps. Your watch might count heartbeats. But do you know what these numbers mean? More importantly, do you know how to use them to feel better, sleep better, and live longer?

### Why Tracking Helps

Your body talks to you all the time. When you're tired, hungry, or stressed, your body sends signals. Metrics help you understand these signals better.

Research shows that people who track just one simple metric like daily steps increase their physical activity by an average of 2,000 steps per day (Cadmus-Bertram et al., 2015). That's like adding a 20-minute walk to your day without even thinking about it.

### The Science Behind It

Studies from major hospitals show that people who track their health metrics make better decisions about exercise, sleep, and food (Zhang et al., 2016). The American Heart Association found that simple tracking helps people live longer, healthier lives (Lee et al., 2019).

When you see your numbers go up or down, you learn what helps and what hurts. This makes you smarter about your health choices.

### What Makes This Different

This guide is part of a bigger program called the "World's Fastest Centenarian Specialization." You'll learn not just to track your health, but to become your own health scientist.

## Page 2: The Four Key Numbers You Need to Know

You don't need to track everything. Start with these four simple numbers:

### 1. Resting Heart Rate

**What It Is:** How many times your heart beats per minute when you're relaxed.

**Why It Matters:** A lower resting heart rate usually means your heart is strong and healthy. As you get fitter, this number often goes down.

**Normal Range:** Most adults have a resting heart rate between 60-100 beats per minute.

**How to Check:** Count your pulse for 60 seconds first thing in the morning, before you get out of bed.

### 2. Daily Steps

**What It Is:** How many steps you take each day.

**Why It Matters:** Steps are the simplest way to track if you're moving enough. More steps usually mean better health.

**Goal:** Start with 6,000 steps per day. Work up to 8,000-10,000 steps over time.

**How to Check:** Your phone probably counts automatically. You can also use a simple step counter.

### 3. Sleep Hours

**What It Is:** How long you sleep each night.

**Why It Matters:** Good sleep helps your body recover and your brain think clearly. Poor sleep makes everything harder.

**Goal:** Most adults need 7-9 hours of sleep per night.

**How to Track:** Write down when you go to bed and when you wake up.

### 4. Energy Level

**What It Is:** How you feel throughout the day on a scale of 1-10.

**Why It Matters:** This connects your other metrics to how you actually feel. You might have great numbers but still feel tired. That tells you something important.

**How to Track:** Rate your energy from 1 (exhausted) to 10 (full of energy) three times per day: morning, afternoon, and evening.

### Simple Tools That Work

**Free Phone Apps:**
- iPhone Users: The "Health" app comes free with your phone
- Android Users: "Google Fit" is free and tracks steps automatically

**Optional Devices:**
- Basic fitness trackers cost $50-100
- Smartwatches cost $200-400
- Paper journal costs almost nothing

Research shows that most consumer wearables are 85-95% accurate for heart rate and step counting (Shcherbina et al., 2017). This is good enough for tracking trends and making health decisions.

### Understanding Your Numbers

**Normal Daily Changes:**
- Heart rate can vary by 5-8 beats per minute each day
- Step counts might change by 20-30% based on your schedule
- Sleep can vary by 1-2 hours based on stress and activities

**When to Pay Attention:**
- Heart rate stays high for several days
- Steps drop by more than half for a week
- Sleep problems last more than a few days
- Energy stays low for more than a week

### Making Smart Choices

**Start Small:** Pick one metric to improve. For example, "I want to walk 500 more steps each day this week."

**Daily Decisions:**
- If your heart rate is high in the morning, take it easy that day
- If you slept poorly, prioritize good sleep the next night
- If your steps are low, take a walking break

**Weekly Planning:**
- Look at your week's data on Sunday
- Plan activities for the coming week based on what you learned
- Adjust your goals if needed

### Building Lasting Success

**Week 1:** Focus on consistent tracking for just one week.

**Month 1:** You understand your baseline numbers and start seeing daily patterns.

**Month 3:** You can predict how certain activities affect your metrics.

**Year 1:** Tracking feels automatic, and you use data to make health decisions without thinking about it.

Small improvements add up over time. Research shows that just 1% improvement each day leads to being 37 times better over a year (Clear, 2018).
