**What's Inside:**
- The 4 key health numbers that matter most
- Simple tools to track them (most are free)

## Email 2: Your First Week Tracking Tips (Day 3)

**Subject:** How's your tracking going? [Quick wins inside]

Hi [First Name],

It's been a few days since you downloaded the fitness metrics guide. How's your tracking going?

**If you haven't started yet - no worries!** Here's the simplest way to begin:

**Today's Action:** Pick ONE of these:
1. **Steps:** Use your phone's built-in step counter
2. **Sleep:** Note what time you go to bed and wake up
3. **Energy:** Rate your morning energy 1-10 when you wake up

That's it. Just track one number for the next 4 days.

**Why this works:** Small data points create big insights over time. After a week, you'll start seeing patterns you never noticed before.

**Real example:** One student tracked her morning energy for 2 weeks and discovered she felt 30% better on days she went to bed before 10:30 PM. Simple change, big impact.

**Question for you:** What's the biggest challenge you face with staying consistent with healthy habits?

Hit reply and let me know - I read every response personally.

Keep tracking,
Brand Anthony McDonald
