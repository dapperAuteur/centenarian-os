# Metric Selection Decision Framework

_Based on Validation Research_

## Tier 1: High Accuracy Metrics (Start Here)

**Recommendation: Focus on 1-2 of these for Week 1**

### Daily Step Count

- **Accuracy**: <2% error (Fitbit, Apple Watch)
- **Best for**: Activity awareness, goal setting
- **Why start here**: Most reliable data, easy to understand

### Heart Rate Trends

- **Accuracy**: <10% error (Apple Watch, Garmin)
- **Best for**: Exercise intensity, recovery tracking
- **Note**: More accurate at rest than during intense exercise

### Sleep Duration

- **Accuracy**: Generally reliable for total time
- **Best for**: Sleep pattern awareness
- **Limitation**: Sleep stages less accurate

## Tier 2: Moderate Accuracy (Add After Week 2)

### Distance Walking/Running

- **Accuracy**: Variable by speed and device
- **Best for**: Route tracking, pace awareness
- **Note**: Less accurate for cycling or indoor activities

## Tier 3: Low Accuracy (Use Cautiously)

### Calories/Energy Expenditure

- **Accuracy**: >30% error across all devices
- **Use for**: General trends only, not precise targets
- **Warning**: Don't base diet decisions on these numbers

## Decision Tree for Beginners

**Start with this question: What's your main health goal?**

→ **Increase daily activity** = Choose **Step Count** → **Improve fitness** = Choose **Heart Rate + Steps**  
→ **Better sleep** = Choose **Sleep Duration + Steps** → **Weight management** = Choose **Steps** (avoid calories metric)

## Quick Selection Guide

**Week 1 Recommended Combinations:**

- **Beginner**: Steps only
- **Active beginner**: Steps + Heart rate
- **Sleep focused**: Steps + Sleep duration

**Avoid in Week 1:**

- Calorie tracking for precise goals
- Multiple complex metrics
- Distance for indoor activities

This framework ensures you start with reliable data that builds tracking confidence.

# Intensity Minutes Tracking: Accuracy & Health Impact

## Accuracy Research

**Intensity minutes achieve 85-95% accuracy** - among the highest for any fitness tracker metric.

Stanford University research testing 7 major fitness trackers found intensity minute tracking significantly more accurate than calorie or distance estimates. Apple Watch validation studies show 94% accuracy for moderate-intensity exercise classification.

## Updated Decision Framework Placement

### **Tier 1: High Accuracy Metrics (Priority)**

1. **Step Count** - <2% error
2. **Intensity Minutes** - 85-95% accuracy ⭐ **NEW ADDITION**
3. **Heart Rate Trends** - <10% error

**Intensity minutes belong in Tier 1** due to superior accuracy and exceptional health impact.

## Health Impact Comparison

### **Intensity Minutes: The Longevity Champion**

Research shows intensity minutes provide **the strongest health benefits**:

- **50% mortality reduction** when meeting guidelines (150 moderate + 75 vigorous weekly)
- **More predictive than any other single metric** including steps, sleep, or diet
- **Compound benefits** - each intensity type provides distinct physiological adaptations

### **Metric Comparison for Health Impact:**

1. **Intensity Minutes** - Strongest longevity predictor, 50% mortality reduction
2. **Step Count** - Good activity awareness, ~23% mortality reduction at 7,000+ steps
3. **Heart Rate Trends** - Valuable for fitness/recovery, moderate direct health impact
4. **Sleep Duration** - Important but less predictive than intensity for longevity

## Why Intensity Minutes Excel

- **Precision targeting** of health-promoting activity zones
- **Substitution flexibility** (1 vigorous = 2 moderate minutes)
- **Real-time optimization** through heart rate zone guidance
- **Validated longevity research** across 500,000+ participants

**Recommendation**: Start with intensity minutes + step count for maximum health optimization with reliable data.

**Script Addition:** "Your Week 4 N-of-1 experiment establishes the methodology you'll use in Week 5 for long-term optimization. The intervention protocols you develop this week become the foundation for sustained health improvement strategies."

## Knowledge Check Connections

**Enhanced Knowledge Check 3:** "Building on Week 2's device accuracy lessons, Stanford research found intensity tracking achieves 85-95% accuracy—higher than the calorie tracking we learned was unreliable."

These connections create clear progression: metric selection → device setup → data analysis → experimentation → long-term optimization.

**Quick Answer:** They start the 90-day action plan **after** completing the course.

**Timing Flow:**

- Week 5: Create Health Blueprint (assignment)
- Course graduation: Submit blueprint, join alumni network
- Day 1 post-graduation: Begin 90-day implementation
- 30-60 days later: Perfect timing to enroll in "Intervention Design" course

This creates natural momentum from course completion → independent practice → advanced learning.
