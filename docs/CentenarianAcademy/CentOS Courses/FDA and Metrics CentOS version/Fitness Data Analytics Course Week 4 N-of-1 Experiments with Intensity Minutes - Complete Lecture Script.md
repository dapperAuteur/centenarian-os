## **Lecture Opening: The Power of Personal Science (15 minutes)**

### **Script:**
"Welcome to Week 4, where we transform from passive data collectors into active health scientists. Today, we'll learn how to conduct N-of-1 experiments—the gold standard for personalized health optimization—using intensity minutes as our primary metric.

**What is an N-of-1 Experiment?**
An N-of-1 experiment is a clinical trial conducted on a single individual—you. Unlike population studies that average results across thousands of people, N-of-1 trials provide personalized insights that directly apply to your unique physiology and lifestyle (Lillie et al., 2011).

**Why Intensity Minutes?**
Today we introduce intensity minutes as our experimental metric because landmark research has identified it as the strongest predictor of longevity. The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study, following 130,000 participants across 17 countries for seven years, found that moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was the most powerful predictor of longevity—stronger than diet, sleep, or stress management (Lear et al., 2017).

**The Revolutionary Findings:**
- Individuals meeting both moderate (150 minutes weekly) and vigorous (75 minutes weekly) intensity guidelines experienced a 50% reduction in all-cause mortality
- This effect size exceeds most pharmaceutical interventions
- The UK Biobank study of 500,000 participants confirmed that intensity matters more than duration (Doherty et al., 2017)"

### **Knowledge Check 1:**
**Question:** What makes N-of-1 experiments different from population studies?

**Answer:** N-of-1 experiments focus on a single individual (n=1) rather than averaging results across many people, providing personalized insights that directly apply to your unique circumstances.

## **Section 1: The Science of Intensity Minutes (20 minutes)**

### **Script:**
"Before we design our N-of-1 experiment, we need to understand what we're measuring and why it matters.

**Defining Intensity Zones**
Research defines intensity using Metabolic Equivalents (METs) and heart rate percentages (Ainsworth et al., 2011):

- **Moderate Intensity (3-6 METs)**: 50-70% of maximum heart rate, feels 'somewhat hard'
  - Examples: Brisk walking, recreational cycling, water aerobics
- **Vigorous Intensity (6+ METs)**: 70-85% of maximum heart rate, feels 'hard to very hard'  
  - Examples: Running, swimming laps, high-intensity interval training

**Device Accuracy**
Stanford University research testing seven major fitness trackers found that intensity minute tracking achieves 85-95% accuracy—significantly higher than calorie or distance estimates (Shcherbina et al., 2017). This precision makes intensity minutes ideal for N-of-1 experiments.

**The Longevity Evidence**
The UK Biobank analysis revealed crucial findings about intensity distribution (Doherty et al., 2017):
- **Moderate Intensity Effects**: 20-30% reduction in all-cause mortality
- **Vigorous Intensity Effects**: 35-40% reduction in mortality
- **Combined Effect**: Following both guidelines produces cumulative benefits exceeding either approach alone

**The Norwegian HUNT Study**
This 20+ year follow-up of 50,000 participants demonstrated that intensity distribution matters more than total volume (Nauman et al., 2016):
- High moderate, low vigorous: 25% mortality reduction
- Balanced moderate + vigorous: 35% mortality reduction  
- High vigorous, moderate: 40% mortality reduction"

### **Knowledge Check 2:**
**Question:** According to the research, what weekly targets provide optimal longevity benefits?

**Answer:** 150 minutes of moderate intensity + 75 minutes of vigorous intensity weekly, which together can reduce all-cause mortality by up to 50%.

## **Section 2: N-of-1 Experiment Design Fundamentals (25 minutes)**

### **Script:**
"Now let's learn how to apply scientific methodology to your personal intensity optimization.

**Core Principles of N-of-1 Experiments**
Successful N-of-1 trials require four essential elements (Lillie et al., 2011):

1. **Single Variable Focus**: Change only one thing at a time
2. **Baseline Establishment**: Collect consistent data before making changes
3. **Systematic Implementation**: Follow a structured protocol
4. **Objective Measurement**: Use reliable, repeatable metrics

**Your Intensity Minutes N-of-1 Framework**

**Phase 1: Baseline Assessment (Week 1)**
- Track current intensity patterns for 7 consecutive days
- Use your fitness device to automatically classify moderate vs. vigorous minutes
- Calculate weekly averages and identify pattern variations
- Note which activities contribute most to each intensity zone

**Phase 2: Hypothesis Formation (Day 8)**
Based on your baseline data, create a testable hypothesis. Examples:
- 'If I add two 15-minute HIIT sessions weekly, I will increase vigorous intensity minutes by 30 minutes'
- 'If I take walking meetings three times per week, I will increase moderate intensity minutes by 45 minutes'

**Phase 3: Intervention Implementation (Weeks 2-3)**
- Implement ONE specific change to your routine
- Continue tracking intensity minutes daily
- Maintain all other lifestyle factors constant
- Document any barriers or unexpected challenges

**Phase 4: Analysis and Evaluation (Week 4)**
- Compare intervention period to baseline
- Calculate percentage changes in target intensity zone
- Assess sustainability and enjoyment factors
- Determine if the intervention achieved your hypothesis

**Statistical Considerations for Personal Experiments**
Research shows that N-of-1 trials can achieve statistical power equivalent to randomized controlled trials when properly designed (Lillie et al., 2011). Key principles:
- Minimum 7-day baseline periods
- At least 14-day intervention periods  
- Account for normal day-to-day variation (typically 15-25%)
- Look for changes exceeding 20% from baseline for meaningful significance"

### **Knowledge Check 3:**
**Question:** What is the minimum recommended duration for each phase of an N-of-1 experiment?

**Answer:** Minimum 7 days for baseline assessment and at least 14 days for intervention implementation to account for normal variation and achieve reliable results.

## **Section 3: Practical N-of-1 Implementation with Intensity Minutes (20 minutes)**

### **Script:**
"Let's work through designing your personal intensity minutes N-of-1 experiment.

**Step 1: Device Setup and Calibration**
Research from the American College of Sports Medicine provides the formulas for accurate heart rate zone calculation (ACSM, 2018):
- Maximum Heart Rate = 220 - age
- Moderate Zone = (Max HR - Resting HR) × 0.5-0.7 + Resting HR
- Vigorous Zone = (Max HR - Resting HR) × 0.7-0.85 + Resting HR

Configure your device with these personalized zones rather than using age-only defaults.

**Step 2: Baseline Data Collection Protocol**
For your 7-day baseline period:
- Wear your device consistently (minimum 16 hours daily)
- Maintain normal activity patterns—don't change anything yet
- Record daily totals for moderate and vigorous intensity minutes
- Note which activities trigger intensity zone classification
- Track sleep quality and energy levels as potential confounding variables

**Step 3: Intervention Selection**
Choose interventions based on current evidence and personal preferences:

**For Moderate Intensity Increases:**
- Walking meetings (research shows 15-20 moderate minutes per 30-minute meeting)
- Active transportation (cycling/walking to work)
- Extended household activities (gardening, cleaning)
- Social activities (dancing, recreational sports)

**For Vigorous Intensity Increases:**
- High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) - most time-efficient
- Running or jogging intervals
- Competitive sports participation
- Circuit training workouts

**Step 4: Data Analysis Framework**
Apply statistical thinking to your results:
- Calculate baseline mean and standard deviation
- Determine if intervention results exceed baseline + 2 standard deviations
- Look for patterns: Which days showed greatest improvements?
- Consider practical significance: Was the change meaningful to you?"

### **Knowledge Check 4:**
**Question:** Why is it important to maintain normal activity patterns during the baseline period?

**Answer:** To establish an accurate representation of your typical intensity patterns. Changing activities during baseline would compromise the validity of comparing intervention results to your true baseline.

## **Section 4: Advanced N-of-1 Analysis and Iteration (15 minutes)**

### **Script:**
"Successful N-of-1 experimentation involves continuous refinement based on results.

**Interpreting Your Results**
Research from the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology identifies three types of outcomes in N-of-1 trials (Lillie et al., 2011):

1. **Clear Positive Response**: Intervention consistently improves target metric
2. **No Response**: No meaningful change from baseline
3. **Negative Response**: Intervention worsens target metric or creates unwanted side effects

**What Each Outcome Means:**
- **Positive Response**: Continue intervention, consider gradual progression
- **No Response**: Modify intervention parameters or try different approach
- **Negative Response**: Discontinue intervention, return to baseline, try alternative

**Progressive Experimentation**
Once you establish effective interventions, research supports progressive optimization (Piercy et al., 2018):
- Increase intervention intensity by 10-15% weekly
- Add complementary interventions one at a time
- Test optimal timing and frequency variations
- Experiment with different activity types within intensity zones

**Long-term Protocol Development**
Transform successful N-of-1 experiments into sustainable protocols:
- Document specific activities, durations, and timing
- Create backup plans for schedule disruptions
- Establish maintenance targets based on proven personal responses
- Plan periodic re-testing to account for fitness improvements"

### **Knowledge Check 5:**
**Question:** If your N-of-1 experiment shows no response, what should your next step be?

**Answer:** Modify the intervention parameters (increase intensity, duration, or frequency) or try a completely different approach, rather than simply continuing the same intervention.
