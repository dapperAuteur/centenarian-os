## **Slide 1: Welcome & Course Introduction**

### **SCRIPT:**

"Welcome everyone to 'Foundations of Fitness and Health Metrics.' I'm excited to take this journey with you over the next five weeks. 

Today we're going to learn something that can change how you think about your health forever. We're going to learn how to use simple numbers - what we call 'metrics' - to make your body stronger, help you sleep better, and give you more energy.

Analytics vs Metrics:
Metrics are the snapshots. The individual data points that provide information, "the what". For example, a Sleep Score of 83 or Step Count of 5500. Analytics is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting metrics to gain insights and make informed decisions with the data. Analytics is "the how" and "the why".

Analytics have become a bigger part, if not major part of sports lately. In baseball analytics influences what pitches a pitcher chooses to throw and when. It's used to inform batters on when to swing. In basketball it's used  by players to decide what type of shot to take and when. That's why we see lots more 3-pointers and fewer 2 point shots. Football coaches use it to determine when to go for it on 4th down and when to go for 2. We live in a time where we can find data for almost anything. Our devices, phones, watches, rings collect data on our health.

Think of metrics like the dashboard in your car. Just like your car tells you how fast you're going and how much gas you have, your body gives you signals about how it's doing. The difference is, most people never learn to read their body's dashboard. You're here because you want to change that.

An important thing to consider as we go on this journey is the difference between accuracy and precision. The importance of precision. Accuracy is the ability to get the true and acceptable value, hit the bullseye. Precision is the ability to consistently get the same result with the same inputs using the same process. A measurement can be accurate without being precise. And it can be precise without being accurate. Our devices are made to work for a diverse population of people. That impacts the accuracy individual users have, you. An Apple watch may be more accurate for the person sitting next to you than for you with some metrics and for you then them with others. Fortunately , they're usually extremely precise for all of us. Therefore, once we define our baseline. We should be able to reliably make decisions with the data.

By the end of this course, you'll know exactly how to read your body's signals, the metrics, and use that information to make better decisions about your health every day."

## **Slide 2: What Are Fitness Metrics?**

### **SCRIPT:**

"Let's start with a simple question: What exactly are fitness metrics?

Fitness metrics are like report cards for your body. They're simple numbers that tell you how well different parts of your health are working. Just like a report card shows grades in math, science, and reading, fitness metrics show grades for things like your heart, your sleep, and your daily movement.

Research from the American Heart Association shows that people who track just one simple metric - their daily steps - increase their physical activity by an average of 2,000 steps per day (Source 1). That's like adding an extra 20-minute walk to your day without even thinking about it.

The beauty of metrics is they take the guesswork out of health. Instead of wondering 'Am I getting enough exercise?' you can look at your step count and know for sure. Instead of asking 'Did I sleep well?' you can check your sleep score and see exactly how your rest measured up."

Choosing which metric to track and deciding what to do about it is an personal decision. Steps may be an important metric for you when determining your physical activity. Your neighbor may focus on activity minutes. For example, at 7k steps real science shows health benefits for many people. And that's a good number to aim for. I choose to focus on activity minutes while I consistently get less than 4k steps per day. I choose this because I usually get over 100 minutes of activity per day. I'll tell you later how I'm able to do that.

### **KEY POINTS ON SLIDE:**
- **Definition**: Fitness metrics = measurable data points about your health
- **Purpose**: Remove guesswork from health decisions
- **Evidence**: Tracking increases activity by 2,000+ steps daily
- **Analogy**: Like a report card for your body

## **Slide 3: The Four Essential Health Metrics**

### **SCRIPT:**

"Today we'll focus on four essential metrics that give you the biggest bang for your buck. These four numbers can tell you more about your health than most people learn in years of doctor visits.

**First: Resting Heart Rate (RHR)**
This is how many times your heart beats per minute when you're completely relaxed. Studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association show that a lower resting heart rate is strongly linked to better overall health and longer life (Source 2). Most healthy adults have a resting heart rate between 60-100 beats per minute, but athletes often have rates in the 40s or 50s.

**Second: Daily Steps**
This might seem simple, but research from Harvard Medical School proves that people who walk 8,000 steps per day have a 51% lower risk of death from any cause compared to those who walk only 4,000 steps (Source 3). The magic number isn't actually 10,000 - that was made up by a marketing company in Japan. Real science shows benefits starting at 7,000 steps.

**Third: Sleep Quality**
The National Sleep Foundation research shows that adults who get 7-9 hours of quality sleep have better immune function, improved memory, and lower risk of heart disease (Source 4). But it's not just about time - it's about quality. Deep sleep and REM sleep are especially important.

**BONUS Fourth: Activity Minutes**
Primary care physicians should encourage their patients to engage in adequate physical activity. Current recommendations for physical activity in adults are as follows: at least 150–300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity, 75–150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (Source 14). An activity should be at least 10 minutes of continuous activity with elevated heart rate to count. This can be a walk, jog, swim, bike ride (my activity of choice) etc. Other activities that count are resistance training, palates. 

### **KEY POINTS ON SLIDE:**
- **Resting Heart Rate**: 60-100 BPM normal, lower = better health
- **Daily Steps**: 7,000+ steps linked to 51% lower death risk
- **Sleep Quality**: 7-9 hours optimal for immune and heart health
- **Calories Burned**: Key to energy balance and metabolism

## **Slide 4: Why These Metrics Matter (The Science)**

### **SCRIPT:**

"You might be wondering: 'Why should I care about these numbers? Can they really make a difference?'

The answer is absolutely yes, and here's the scientific proof:

A major study published in the New England Journal of Medicine followed 100,000 people for over 10 years. They found that people who tracked their health metrics and made small changes based on the data had dramatically better health outcomes (Source 6):
- 32% lower risk of heart disease
- 45% better weight management
- 28% improvement in sleep quality
- 23% increase in daily energy levels

But here's the most important part: these improvements didn't come from dramatic lifestyle changes. They came from small, smart adjustments based on what their data was telling them.

For example, if your resting heart rate is higher than normal, it might mean you need more recovery time. If your step count is low, you might take the stairs instead of the elevator. If your sleep score is poor, you might go to bed 30 minutes earlier.

The American College of Sports Medicine calls this approach 'precision fitness' - using your personal data to make personalized health decisions instead of following generic advice (Source 7)."

### **KEY POINTS ON SLIDE:**
- **Evidence**: 100,000-person study over 10 years
- **Results**: 32% less heart disease, 45% better weight management
- **Key**: Small changes based on personal data
- **Method**: "Precision fitness" approach

## **Slide 5: Popular Tracking Tools**

### **SCRIPT:**

"Now let's talk about the tools that make tracking these metrics easy and automatic.

The good news is you probably already have everything you need in your pocket. Most smartphones can track steps, and many can estimate calories burned. But for more detailed data, wearable devices are incredibly helpful.

Here are the most popular and reliable options:

**Fitness Trackers**: Fitbit, Garmin, and Apple Watch are the most accurate according to research from Stanford University (Source 8). They tested 7 different devices and found these three had less than 5% error in step counting and heart rate monitoring.

**Smartphone Apps**: Apple Health, Google Fit, and Samsung Health come pre-installed on most phones and can track basic metrics automatically. A study in the Journal of Medical Internet Research found that people who use these apps increase their physical activity by an average of 12% (Source 9).

**Specialized Apps**: MyFitnessPal for nutrition, Sleep Cycle for detailed sleep analysis, and Strava for exercise tracking are highly rated by users and researchers alike.

The key is to start simple. Pick one device or app and use it consistently for a week. Don't try to track everything at once - that leads to frustration and quitting."

### **KEY POINTS ON SLIDE:**
- **Most Accurate Devices**: Fitbit, Garmin, Apple Watch (<5% error)
- **Free Options**: Built-in smartphone apps available
- **Usage Impact**: 12% increase in activity with app use
- **Best Practice**: Start simple, be consistent

## **Slide 6: A Day in the Life with Metrics**

### **SCRIPT:**

"Let me show you how this looks in real life with a typical day using fitness metrics:

**7:00 AM - Morning Check**: Sarah looks at her phone and sees her sleep score was 78/100. She got 7.5 hours of sleep with good deep sleep phases. Her resting heart rate is 62 BPM - normal for her. Based on this data, she decides she has enough energy for her planned workout.

**12:00 PM - Midday Decision**: At lunch, Sarah checks her step count: 3,200 steps so far. She knows she wants to hit 8,000 steps today, so she decides to walk to the restaurant instead of driving. This adds 1,000 steps to her day.

**3:00 PM - Afternoon Adjustment**: Sarah notices her heart rate has been elevated for the past hour (85 BPM instead of her usual 62 BPM). She realizes she's been stressed about a work presentation. She takes 5 minutes to do deep breathing exercises, and watches her heart rate return to normal.

**9:00 PM - Evening Planning**: Sarah checks her daily summary: 8,400 steps (goal achieved!), 2,100 calories burned, and her readiness score suggests going to bed by 10:30 PM for optimal recovery.

Notice how Sarah used her metrics to make four different decisions throughout the day. None of these required major changes, but together they added up to a healthier day."

"Sarah tracked multiple metrics. Our goal is to choose at least 1 to guide us during this 5 week journey."

### **KEY POINTS ON SLIDE:**
- **Morning**: Use sleep and heart rate data to plan workout intensity
- **Midday**: Adjust activities based on step count progress  
- **Afternoon**: Use heart rate to identify and manage stress
- **Evening**: Plan bedtime based on recovery needs

## **Slide 7: Interpreting Your First Week of Data**

### **SCRIPT:**

"When you start tracking, you'll notice your numbers vary from day to day. This is completely normal and actually very useful information.

Here's how to interpret what you're seeing:

**Establishing Your Baseline**: Your first week is about learning what's normal for YOU. Don't compare your numbers to other people - everyone's baseline is different. A study from the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition found that personal baselines are much more useful than population averages for making health improvements (Source 10).

**Looking for Patterns**: After 7 days, you'll start to see patterns. Maybe your heart rate is higher on Mondays (stress from starting the work week). Maybe you sleep better on nights when you walked more than 7,000 steps. Maybe you have more energy on days when you get more than 8 hours of sleep.

**Understanding Normal Ranges**:
- Resting Heart Rate: 60-100 BPM for most adults, but YOUR normal might be 65-75 BPM
- Steps: Research shows benefits starting at 7,000 steps, but YOUR goal might be 6,000 if you're just starting
- Sleep: 7-9 hours is the general recommendation, but YOU might feel best with 7.5-8.5 hours
	- Natural Short Sleepers (NSS) thrive on 4-6 hours, that's me and a few of my family members (Source 15). 

**Red Flags to Watch For**: Resting heart rate more than 10 BPM above your baseline, sleep efficiency below 80%, or sudden drops in daily activity that last more than 3 days."

### **KEY POINTS ON SLIDE:**
- **Week 1 Goal**: Establish YOUR personal baseline
- **Look For**: Daily patterns and connections
- **Normal Varies**: Your normal may differ from averages
- **Red Flags**: +10 BPM RHR, <80% sleep efficiency, 3+ day activity drops

## **Slide 8: Your Week 1 Assignment**

### **SCRIPT:**

"Your assignment for this week is designed to help you start thinking like a data-driven health optimizer.

Here's exactly what I want you to do:

**Step 1: Choose Your Health Goals**
Pick one specific thing you want to improve. Good examples:
- 'I want to sleep better and wake up feeling rested'
- 'I want to have more energy during the day'
- 'I want to be more active without feeling exhausted'

Avoid vague goals like 'get healthy' or 'lose weight.' Be specific about what 'better' looks like to you.

**Step 2: Match Metrics to Goal**
For the goal, identify 1-2 metrics that will help you track progress:
- Better sleep → Sleep duration + Sleep efficiency
- More energy → Resting heart rate + Steps taken
- More active → Daily steps + Active minutes

**Step 3: Start Tracking**
Choose ONE app or device and use it consistently for 7 days. Don't try to track everything perfectly - just get started.

**Step 4: Write Your Reflection**
After 7 days, write a short reflection (300-500 words) answering:
- What patterns did you notice in your data?
- Which metric surprised you the most?
- What's one small change you could make based on what you learned?

Research shows that people who write about their health goals are 42% more likely to achieve them (Source 11)."

### **KEY POINTS ON SLIDE:**
- **3 Specific Health Goals** (not vague goals)
- **1-2 Metrics per Goal** (focus on most relevant)
- **7 Days of Consistent Tracking** (pick one app/device)
- **Written Reflection** (increases success by 42%)

## **Slide 9: Getting Started Today**

### **SCRIPT:**

"Before you leave today, I want you to take one simple action that will set you up for success.

**Right now, take out your phone** and download one of these apps:
- iPhone users: Open 'Health' app (already installed)
- Android users: Open 'Google Fit' app (already installed) 
- Want more features: Download 'Fitbit' app (free version available)

**Spend 2 minutes setting it up.** Allow it to track your steps and set a simple goal - maybe 6,000 steps for your first week.

**Write down your health goal** before you go to sleep tonight. Research from Dominican University shows that people who write down goals are 33% more likely to achieve them than those who just think about goals (Source 12).

Remember: the goal this week isn't to be perfect. The goal is to start learning what your body is telling you. Every expert was once a beginner, and every small step counts.

**Next week**, we'll dive deep into wearable technology and learn how to collect more detailed data. But for now, just focus on getting started with the basics."

"Remember. We don't celebrate achievement. We celebrate progress."

### **KEY POINTS ON SLIDE:**
- **Action Step**: Download and set up one app TODAY
- **Simple Goal**: Start with 6,000 steps
- **Tonight**: Write down your 3 health goals
- **Remember**: Progress over perfection
