## VIDEO 1: Student Experience (~7 minutes)

---

### INTRO [0:00–0:20]

**[Screen: Centenarian Academy homepage at `/academy`]**

> "Welcome to Centenarian Academy — the learning platform inside CentenarianOS designed to help you build the knowledge, habits, and skills of a long, healthy life. In this video I'll show you everything you need to know as a student: how to find and enroll in courses, watch lessons, navigate a CYOA adventure path, submit assignments, and track your progress."

---

### SECTION 1: BROWSING AND ENROLLING [0:20–2:00]

**[Screen: `/academy` course catalog]**

> "Here's the course catalog. You can browse all available courses — free and paid — and filter by category like Nutrition, Movement, or Mindset. Use the search bar at the top to find something specific."

**[Click on a course card]**

> "Click any course to see the detail page. You get the full description, a look at the curriculum, and information about the instructor. Free preview lessons are marked here — you can watch those even before enrolling."

**[Click Enroll button on a free course]**

> "For free courses, just click Enroll. You're in immediately."

**[Show paid course, click Enroll → Stripe Checkout page]**

> "For paid courses, you'll go through a quick Stripe Checkout. If your instructor gave you a promo code, enter it right here in the discount field. Once payment is done, you're enrolled and the full curriculum unlocks."

---

### SECTION 2: WATCHING A LESSON [2:00–3:30]

**[Screen: Course detail page, curriculum list]**

> "Back on the course page, click any lesson to open it. Lessons come in a few formats — video, audio, text articles, or slides."

**[Open a video lesson]**

> "For a video lesson, just hit play. Watch at your own pace — you can rewind, fast-forward, or change the playback speed. When you reach the end, the lesson is automatically marked complete and your progress updates."

**[Show text lesson]**

> "Text lessons scroll just like an article. Read at your pace — your progress is tracked as you scroll through."

---

### SECTION 3: CYOA — CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE [3:30–5:00]

**[Screen: A CYOA course lesson completion → Crossroads screen]**

> "Some courses have what we call CYOA mode — Choose Your Own Adventure. Instead of a simple Next button, after each lesson you see a Crossroads like this."

**[Show Crossroads UI with 5 options]**

> "You get up to five paths. Option one is the standard next lesson in sequence. Options two and three are lessons the AI found to be semantically related to what you just watched — so if you just learned about intermittent fasting, you might be offered a lesson on metabolic health or circadian rhythm. Option four is a random lesson — for when you want a surprise. And option five opens the full course map so you can jump anywhere."

**[Click a semantic path]**

> "CYOA lets you follow your curiosity and build a learning path that matches how your brain works that day."

---

### SECTION 4: ASSIGNMENTS [5:00–6:15]

**[Screen: Course detail page → Assignments section]**

> "If your course includes assignments, they'll appear here on the course page once you're enrolled. Click an assignment to open it."

**[Open assignment page]**

> "Read the instructions at the top. Then type your response in the text area. You can also attach files — photos, videos, audio recordings, PDFs, Word documents — up to five files per submission."

**[Click Save Draft]**

> "Hit Save Draft to save your work without submitting. Your instructor won't be notified yet. This is great when you want to come back and finish later."

**[Click Submit]**

> "When you're ready, click Submit. Your instructor will be notified and can grade your work. Once graded, a banner appears at the top with your grade and feedback."

**[Show Feedback Thread]**

> "The Feedback Thread at the bottom lets you have a back-and-forth conversation with your instructor about your work."

---

### SECTION 5: MY COURSES [6:15–7:00]

**[Screen: `/academy/my-courses`]**

> "Your My Courses page shows every course you're enrolled in, with a progress bar for each one. Click Continue to jump back to exactly where you left off. When a course reaches 100%, it's marked Complete."

---

### OUTRO [7:00–7:20]

> "That's the full student experience in Centenarian Academy. Browse, enroll, learn at your pace, follow your own adventure, submit your work, and track your progress — all in one place. See you in the next video."

---
---

## VIDEO 2: Teacher Experience (~8 minutes)

---

### INTRO [0:00–0:25]

**[Screen: `/dashboard/teaching`]**

> "In this video I'll walk you through everything you need to know to create and run a course on Centenarian Academy as a teacher. We'll cover setting up your account, building your curriculum, managing assignments, and getting paid."

---

### SECTION 1: TEACHER ONBOARDING [0:25–1:30]

**[Screen: Teaching dashboard with subscription prompt]**

> "To become a teacher, you subscribe to the Centenarian Academy Teacher plan from your dashboard. Click Subscribe and complete the Stripe checkout."

**[Screen: Payouts page]**

> "Once you're a teacher, head to the Payouts page and click Connect with Stripe. This takes you through Stripe's Express onboarding — you'll verify your identity and add your bank account. This is required for any paid course you create. Free courses don't need it. Once connected, your platform share of student enrollments is automatically sent to your bank."

---

### SECTION 2: CREATING A COURSE [1:30–3:00]

**[Screen: `/dashboard/teaching/courses/new`]**

> "To create a course, go to Dashboard, then Teaching, then New Course."

**[Fill in form fields on screen]**

> "Give your course a title — something clear and searchable. Write a compelling description. Choose a category. Upload a cover image that represents your course. Then set your pricing: free, a one-time purchase, or a monthly subscription."

**[Show navigation mode selector]**

> "And here's where you choose your navigation mode. Linear is the standard — students go through lessons in order. CYOA mode enables the Choose Your Own Adventure crossroads after every lesson. Pick CYOA if you have content that works across multiple topics or pathways."

**[Click Create Course]**

> "Click Create. Your course starts as a draft — students can't see it yet."

---

### SECTION 3: BUILDING YOUR CURRICULUM [3:00–5:00]

**[Screen: Course editor `/dashboard/teaching/courses/[id]`]**

> "Now you're in the course editor. Start by adding your first module — think of modules as chapters or weeks. Click Add Module, type the name, hit Enter."

**[Add a lesson under a module]**

> "Under each module, click Add Lesson. Give the lesson a title and pick the type: video, audio, text, or slides."

**[Show video upload]**

> "For video and audio, drag your file onto the upload area or click to browse. Cloudinary handles transcoding — your video will be playable on any device. For text lessons, just type directly in the editor."

**[Toggle free preview]**

> "Toggle Free Preview on a lesson to let non-enrolled visitors watch it. This is a great way to show potential students what your teaching style is like."

**[Show drag-to-reorder]**

> "Drag lessons and modules to reorder them. When your curriculum is ready, go to the Settings panel and toggle Published. Your course is now live in the catalog."

---

### SECTION 4: CYOA — GENERATING AI PATHS [5:00–5:45]

**[Screen: Course editor, CYOA course]**

> "If you chose CYOA mode, you'll see a Generate AI Paths button here. Once all your lessons are uploaded, click it. The system sends each lesson's content to our AI model and generates semantic similarity scores between all your lessons. This is what powers the Related options on the Crossroads screen. It takes a minute — run it once after adding all your lessons, and again if you add new content later."

---

### SECTION 5: ASSIGNMENTS [5:45–6:45]

**[Screen: `/dashboard/teaching/courses/[id]/assignments`]**

> "Click Assignments in the course editor header to manage assignments for this course."

**[Create assignment]**

> "Click New Assignment. Write the title, detailed instructions, and an optional due date. Assignments appear on the course page for all enrolled students."

**[Expand a submission row]**

> "When students submit work, you'll see the submission count on each assignment row. Click to expand it. You can read their written response and view any attachments. Enter a grade — this can be a letter grade, a score, or just written feedback. Click Save Grade. The student sees this immediately on their assignment page."

---

### SECTION 6: PROMO CODES AND LIVE SESSIONS [6:45–7:30]

**[Screen: Promo codes page]**

> "Create promo codes to offer discounts — for a launch sale, a community group, or a scholarship. Enter the code, the discount percentage, and an optional expiration date. Students enter the code at Stripe Checkout."

**[Screen: Live sessions page]**

> "Schedule live sessions from the Live Sessions page. Paste in an embed code from Zoom, Google Meet, Mux, or any streaming service. Toggle Is Live when your stream starts — enrolled students can join directly from the course page."

---

### OUTRO [7:30–8:00]

> "That's the full teacher workflow on Centenarian Academy. Build your curriculum, generate your CYOA paths, manage assignments, run live sessions, and collect payouts — all from your teaching dashboard. Your knowledge helps people live longer, healthier lives. We're excited to have you here."

---
---

## VIDEO 3: Admin Experience (~5 minutes)

---

### INTRO [0:00–0:20]

**[Screen: Admin panel]**

> "This video is for Centenarian Academy platform administrators. We'll cover the settings you need to configure before launching, how to manage live sessions, and how to oversee courses and teacher accounts."

---

### SECTION 1: PLATFORM SETTINGS [0:20–1:45]

**[Screen: `/admin/academy/settings`]**

> "Start at Academy Settings. The two most important settings here are the platform fee percentage and the teacher plan Stripe Price ID."

**[Point to fee field]**

> "The platform fee is the percentage of each paid enrollment that goes to the platform. The default is 15 percent. Change it here — it applies to all future checkouts."

**[Point to price ID field]**

> "The Teacher Stripe Price ID is how the platform knows which Stripe subscription makes someone a teacher. Go to your Stripe dashboard, create a product called 'Centenarian Academy Teacher', create a monthly price for it, copy the Price ID — it starts with price_ — and paste it here. Save. Now when users subscribe to that price, the webhook automatically sets their role to teacher."

**[Show environment variables note]**

> "Make sure this same Price ID is also set as TEACHER_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID in your environment variables."

---

### SECTION 2: LIVE SESSIONS [1:45–3:15]

**[Screen: `/admin/live`]**

> "The Live Sessions page is where you manage CentenarianOS Team broadcasts — these are platform-wide sessions, separate from individual teacher live sessions."

**[Click New Session]**

> "Create a session, give it a title and description, set the scheduled time. Most importantly, paste in your embed code. We use Viloud.tv — paste the full iframe HTML. Set visibility to Public for anyone or Members Only for subscribers."

**[Toggle Go Live]**

> "When your stream is actually live, toggle the Is Live button. This activates the Join Live button for users at the Live page. Toggle it off when the stream ends."

---

### SECTION 3: COURSES OVERVIEW [3:15–4:00]

**[Screen: `/admin/academy`]**

> "The Academy overview shows every course on the platform — published and draft. You can see enrollment counts, teacher names, and visibility status at a glance. As admin you can view any course detail page, unpublish if needed, or manage content that violates platform guidelines."

---

### SECTION 4: USER ROLES AND TEACHER ACCOUNTS [4:00–4:40]

**[Screen: Admin users page]**

> "User roles are managed on the Users page. Members can enroll in courses. Teachers can create and publish courses. Admins have full access. You can manually promote a user to teacher here — useful for onboarding staff or beta teachers before the subscription flow is set up."

> "For Stripe Connect oversight, log into your Stripe dashboard and navigate to Connect → Accounts to see all connected teacher accounts and payout history."

---

### OUTRO [4:40–5:00]

> "That covers the admin side of Centenarian Academy. Once you've set your platform fee, configured the teacher plan price, and tested the Stripe webhook, the platform runs itself. Teachers create content, students enroll, and payouts happen automatically. If you have questions, the full admin guide is in the platform docs."
