# **Centenarian Journey: Integrated 2-Week Strategy Compendium**

Cycle: Integration Meso-Cycle (Weeks 2 & 3\)  
Start Date: Monday, 2025-10-20  
Focus: Re-integrate strength training only after permanent pelvic stability is achieved. Enforce the Anti-Sitting Constraint (Max 20 min seated).

## **1\. Integrated 2-Week Schedule (Oct 20 \- Nov 2\)**

This schedule is non-negotiable. The **ILAI Corrective PAP** is a mandatory Phase 1 component of every strength day.

| Day | Time Slot | Goal Tag | Activity Description | Strategic Focus & Constraint (The 'Why') |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **MON** | 04:00 AM | FITNESS | **Phase 1: ILAI Corrective PAP (Mandatory)**. **Phase 2: Cent OS Strength Workout (60% Volume)**: Eccentric Pull-ups 3x4, Incline Push-ups 3x10-12, Hanging Knee Raise w/ PPT 3x8. | **CRITICAL:** ILAI prepares the core and hips. 60% volume tests the new movement pattern safely. Log pain: intensity **must** be 0/10 during execution. |  |  |
|  | 16:00 PM | CREATIVE | **Creative Focus: Record Corvid Podcast (1-2 episodes)**. Draft outline for Module A: Planner TDD/User Stories. | **STANDING MANDATE:** Must be done standing or on the floor. Eliminates prolonged hip flexion, undoing the morning's ILAI work. |  |  |
|  | 20:30 PM | LIFESTYLE | **Sleep Posture Protocol** (Pillow between knees/under knees). No screens after 21:00. | Permanent passive constraint to stabilize the pelvis and prevent APT regression during sleep. |  |  |
| **TUE** | 04:00 AM | LIFESTYLE | **Morning Maintenance: Full Hip/Shoulder I\&L Protocol**. Prep *Tropical Inflammation Control Bowl*. | Focus: mobility before work. Nutrition Prep is efficient time investment (Module B: Fuel). |  |  |
|  | 16:00 PM | SKILL | **Evening Skill & Recovery (Front Lever & Core Stability)**. **Action:** 45 min: 3 sets of max-hold Tuck Front Lever & 3 sets of Bird-Dog. 15 min: Splits Protocol. | Use Bird-Dog (ILAI Integrate) to reinforce core stability immediately before the higher-skill Front Lever holds. |  |  |
| **WED** | 04:00 AM | FITNESS | **Phase 1: ILAI Corrective PAP (Mandatory)**. **Phase 2: Cent OS Strength Workout (60% Volume)**: Pike Push-ups 3x6-8, TRX Bicep Curl 3x10, Russian Twist 3x15/side. | Focus $100\\%$ on *core stability* and strict form in Russian Twists. Stop if intensity \> 3/10 pain. |  |  |
|  | 16:00 PM | CREATIVE | **Creative Focus: Record/Edit Corvid Podcast (Secondary session/editing).** Outline TDD for Module B: Fuel (Protocol & Inventory). | **STANDING MANDATE:** Edit work must be done standing. Focus on high-quality audio output (VO skill application). |  |  |
| **THU** | 04:00 AM | LIFESTYLE | **Morning Maintenance: Full Hip/Shoulder I\&L Protocol**. | Active recovery and mobility focus. |  |  |
|  | 16:00 PM | SKILL | **Skill & Creative Synergy: Standing VO Practice & Visual Storytelling**. (45 min VO, 45 min Art). | **STANDING MANDATE:** Test the standing posture for long periods. Every element must be a portfolio piece. |  |  |
| **FRI** | 04:00 AM | FITNESS | **Phase 1: ILAI Corrective PAP (Mandatory)**. **Phase 2: Cent OS Strength Workout (60% Volume)**: TRX Chest Press 3xMax, Inverted Row 3xMax, Hollow Body Hold 3x45s. | Monitor form breakdown. Failure is when the form breaks (e.g., lower back arches), not when the muscle fails. |  |  |
|  | 16:00 PM | CREATIVE | **Strategic Review & Upload**. Final check of all recorded/edited content. **Write 5 C’s Critique** of your best social media post from the week. | Close the content flywheel loop. Generate critique data for future content training. |  |  |
| **SAT** | 10:00 AM | FITNESS | **Extended Zone 2 Cardio (60-90 min)**. Followed by Full ILAI. | **Active Recovery:** Focus on **Posterior Pelvic Tilt** while walking/cycling to reinforce core control during low-intensity movement. |  |  |

## **2\. Movement & Skill Execution Rubric**

This section provides the necessary execution details for all specialized activities.

### **The ILAI Corrective Protocol (Phase 1 PAP)**

**ILAI** stands for **Inhibit, Lengthen, Activate, Integrate**. It is the corrective strategy that must precede your strength work to address your Anterior Pelvic Tilt (APT) and hip instability.

| Stage | Exercise / Technique | Reps/Duration | Execution Cue (The 'How') | Purpose (The 'Why') |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **INHIBIT** | **Vibrating Roller on TFL & Quads** | 2 sets per side, 30 seconds on each trigger point. | Lie face down. Target the side of the hip/top of the thigh. Move slowly and pause on points of intense tension. | Desensitizes the overactive, tight muscles that are pulling your pelvis into a pain-inducing APT. |
| **LENGTHEN** | **Kneeling Hip Flexor Stretch** | 3 sets per side, 30-second hold. | **CRITICAL:** Actively tuck your tailbone (Posterior Pelvic Tilt, or PPT) before leaning forward. You should feel the stretch high in the groin/front of the hip. | Lengthens the psoas and hip flexors, allowing the pelvis to assume a neutral position. |
| **ACTIVATE** | **Glute Bridge** (with PPT) | 3 sets, 12 reps, 3-second hold at the top. | **CRITICAL:** **Tuck your pelvis (PPT) before lifting.** Ensure the work is felt in the **glutes**, not the hamstrings or lower back. | Wakes up the inhibited glutes, which are your main sprinting engines and pelvic stabilizers. |
| **ACTIVATE** | **Side-Lying Clamshell** | 3 sets, 15 slow reps per side. | Maintain hip stacked and stable. Only move the top knee. Focus on feeling the contraction in the **side/upper glute (Glute Medius)**. | Strengthens the primary lateral hip stabilizer, preventing hip collapse in motion. |
| **INTEGRATE** | **Bird-Dog** | 3 sets, 8 reps per side (slow, 3s hold). | Start on hands/knees. Extend opposite arm/leg simultaneously. **CRITICAL:** Do not allow your lower back to arch or rotate. Focus on moving the limbs without moving the torso. | Reinforces the ability of the deep core to stabilize the pelvis and spine during movement. |

### **Skill & Strength Deconstruction**

| Activity | Equipment | Execution Cue | Strategic Goal Link |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Eccentric Pull-ups** | Power Tower | Use a step to get your chin over the bar. Focus 100% on a **5-second controlled lowering (negative)**. Do not pull up. | Builds foundational pulling strength and reinforces scapular depression control—necessary for future front lever and shoulder health. |
| **Hanging Knee Raise w/ PPT** | Power Tower | Initiate every rep by tucking your tailbone **(PPT)**. The movement is driven by the lower abs, not the hip flexors. | Directly strengthens the deep rectus abdominis and is a corrective drill for hip flexion dominance. |
| **Tuck Front Lever Hold** | Power Tower/Bar | Hang from bar. Pull knees tightly to chest and tuck the pelvis **(PPT)**. Brace core as hard as possible to keep the back flat (parallel to the ground). Hold max time. | High-skill development. Builds total body tension required for advanced calisthenics (Front Lever). |
| **Splits Protocol** | Floor/Mats | Focus on achieving the **anterior tilt** of the pelvis (leaning forward) in the deep lunge/half-split position. Use the ILAI stretching (hip flexor focus) beforehand. | Non-negotiable daily exposure to end-range flexibility required for long-term sprint stride and mobility. |

## **3\. Fuel Protocol: Tropical Inflammation Control Bowl**

This is your core pre-prep meal (Module B: Fuel) designed to maximize recovery and provide sustained energy, integrating the **NCV (Nutritional Color Value)** framework.

### **Recipe: Tropical Inflammation Control Bowl**

| Ingredient | Quantity | NCV Category | Why (Strategic Benefit) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Greek Yogurt (Plain, 2%) | 32 oz container | Protein | High Casein protein for slow, sustained muscle repair. Probiotics for gut health. |
| Whey Protein Powder | 2 Scoops | Protein | Fast-absorbing Leucine to initiate Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) post-workout. |
| Chia/Hemp Seeds | 1/4 cup total | Fat/Protein | Omega-3s (anti-inflammatory) and high fiber for sustained satiety and gut health. |
| Turmeric (Ground) | 1 Tbsp | Phytonutrient | Curcumin is a potent anti-inflammatory agent. |
| Black Pepper (Ground) | 1/2 tsp | Phytonutrient | Contains Piperine, which increases Curcumin's bioavailability by up to 2,000%. |
| Tropical Fruit (Pineapple/Mango) | 1 cup per serving | Carbohydrate/Micronutrient | Provides Bromelain (protein digestion aid) and Vitamin C (collagen health). |
| Toasted Coconut Flakes | 1 Tbsp per serving | Fat | Provides MCTs (Medium-Chain Triglycerides) for efficient, non-sugar energy. |

### **Meal Prep Instructions (Module B: Protocol)**

1. **Base Mix:** In a large bowl, combine the entire container of Greek yogurt, whey protein, hemp hearts, chia seeds, turmeric, cinnamon, and black pepper.  
2. **Combine:** Mix thoroughly until all powders are fully incorporated.  
3. **Refrigerate:** Transfer the yogurt base into a large airtight container and refrigerate. This allows the chia seeds to hydrate and the base to thicken.  
4. **Daily Serving:** Scoop one serving (\~1 cup) of the chilled base into a smaller bowl and top with frozen fruit and coconut flakes immediately before consumption.

### **Estimated Nutritional Data (Per Serving, \~1 Cup)**

This is an estimate for Phase 1 planning. Exact numbers depend on brand/serving size.

| Macro | Approx. Value | % of Total Calories | NCV Value |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Protein** | 40-45 grams | \~40% | HIGH |
| **Carbohydrates** | 30-35 grams | \~30% | MEDIUM |
| **Fat** | 10-15 grams | \~30% | MEDIUM |
| **Total Calories** | 400 \- 450 kcal | N/A | **GREEN/OPTIMAL** |

**Strategic Rationale:** The 40g+ protein content ensures optimal MPS (Muscle Protein Synthesis). The ratio of Protein/Carb/Fat is balanced for sustained energy, and the spice matrix creates a multi-pathway defense against the inflammation caused by your high-intensity training.
