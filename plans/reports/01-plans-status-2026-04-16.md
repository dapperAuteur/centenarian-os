## 2. Backlog (written, not started)

Each has a matching `plans/validate/NN-slug.md` sign-off file.

| # | Plan | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 24 | Academy 360° transcripts | small (~2 days) | Extract shared `TranscriptPanel`; wire into `Lesson360VideoPlayer`. No migration needed. |
| 25 | Academy 360° offline caching | medium (~1 week) | Service Worker + IndexedDB. Migration 179 is taken; next is 180. iOS Safari blob test flagged as risk. |
| 26 | Academy Insta360 import | medium, **blocked** | §3 external research required before coding (SDK availability, NDA, usage data). May collapse into a drag-and-drop one-day feature. |
| 27 | Academy media library | large (~2 weeks) | Per-teacher library with naming, tagging, fuzzy search, delete/replace. Migration 181. |
| 28 | — | **deleted** | Was destinations/scenes search; belonged to the Wanderlearn project. |
| 29 | Error handling UI/UX/DX | medium | Custom 404/500 pages, error boundaries, toast system, analytics 404 suppression. |

---

## 3. Infrastructure & open blockers

- **Migrations 175–179** must be applied to the deployment. Running 179 is the most recent ask.
- **Analytics 404** at `/a/script.js` and `/a/api/send` — `next.config.mjs` rewrites for PostHog/Plausible are misconfigured or the service endpoint changed. **Not a code issue.** Plan 29 covers graceful handling.
- **School network npm install** — `lightspeed.hseschools.org` intercepts `registry.npmjs.org` and returns HTML, breaking `npm install`. User works around this from home. Type shims were used once (plan 23a) and removed once plugins landed.
- **Cloudinary env var** — set `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix) on Vercel and locally. `next.config.mjs` aliases it to `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` at build time for the upload widget.

---

## 4. Documentation state

- [STYLE_GUIDE.md](../../STYLE_GUIDE.md) — collaboration rules
- [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) — code style and a11y mandates
- `plans/NN-slug.md` — 9 active plans (20–27, 29), 1 deleted (28)
- `plans/validate/NN-slug.md` — validation checklists for each plan
- `content/tutorials/academy/14-360-video-lessons.md` — learner tutorial for 360° lessons
- `content/tutorials/teaching/16-publishing-360-videos.md` — teacher tutorial

---

## 5. Recommended next actions

In order of priority:

1. **Run migration 179** if not already applied (`tour_progress JSONB` on `lesson_progress`).
2. **Plan 24 (360° transcripts)** — smallest remaining piece in the 360° arc; extracts the shared TranscriptPanel and wires it into the video player. Estimated 2 days.
3. **Plan 29 (error handling)** — user-surfaced need after the "black screen on error" report. Medium effort.
4. **Plan 27 (media library)** — large but high-value: naming/tagging/search solves the "LRV_20260408_164622_01_015" readability problem.
5. **Plan 25 (offline)** or **Plan 26 (Insta360)** — defer until 24/27 land and 26's research is unblocked.

---

## 6. Session outcome

### Style guide update — `docs/style-guide-stricter-branching-rule` (`56cccb0`)

Committed to `docs/style-guide-stricter-branching-rule` on 2026-04-16. Awaiting user merge to `main`.

**Files changed (2 insertions, 0 deletions):**

- `STYLE_GUIDE.md` — +18 lines
  - New **§0 "The golden rule: branch first, commit last"** at the top of the document. Spells out the exact five-step workflow (checkout main → pull → branch → edit → commit), names the recovery move for anyone who catches themselves editing on `main` (stash + branch + pop + continue), and states "No exceptions, no direct commits to main, no 'it's just a tiny fix.'"
  - §3 Conventional Commits prefaced with an explicit instruction: **write the commit message at the END of the work**, describing the changes that were actually made — not intent, not ticket title, not plan. Rewrite the body if the diff disagrees.
- `CLAUDE.md` — +2 lines
  - Added a second blockquote at the top summarizing the golden rule with a link to STYLE_GUIDE.md §0, so readers who open the code-style doc first also see the workflow rule.

**Tests:** docs-only change, no typecheck needed (confirmed clean anyway).

**Commit message (actual):**
```
docs(style): make branch-first + descriptive-commit rules unmissable
```
with a three-paragraph body describing the §0 addition, the §3 preface, and the CLAUDE.md link-back.

### Impact on existing plans

None of the plans 20–29 require edits — they were already written and executed assuming these rules were in effect. The update codifies what was already practiced, closes the ambiguity for the next contributor, and gives future-me a clear line to point at if anyone tries to commit to `main`.

### What to do next (unchanged from §5 above)

1. Merge `docs/style-guide-stricter-branching-rule` (`56cccb0`) to `main`. ✓ **Done.**
2. Run migration 179 if not already applied.
3. Proceed with plan 24 (360° transcripts) as the smallest remaining item in the 360° arc. ✓ **Done — see §7 below.**

---

## 7. Plan 24 shipped — `feat/academy-360-transcripts` (`c199b89`)

Committed 2026-04-16. Awaiting user merge to `main`.

**Files changed (5 files, +160 / −93 lines):**

- `components/academy/TranscriptPanel.tsx` (new, 97 lines) — extracted shared transcript UI with click-to-seek, auto-scroll to active segment, and `aria-live="polite"` announcements. Takes `{ transcript, currentTime, onSeek, onCollapse }`.
- `components/academy/VideoPlayer.tsx` (−32 lines net) — removed inline transcript JSX + `transcriptRef` + auto-scroll effect; renders `<TranscriptPanel>` when toggled. No behavior change.
- `components/academy/AudioPlayer.tsx` (−38 lines net) — same refactor. No behavior change.
- `components/academy/Lesson360VideoPlayer.tsx` (+43 lines) — new optional `transcript` prop; VideoPlugin reference captured in a ref so TranscriptPanel's `onSeek` can call `plugin.setTime()`; `currentTime` state updated in the existing 'progress' event listener; new transcript toggle button overlayed top-right on the player; renders `<TranscriptPanel>` below when toggled.
- `app/academy/[courseId]/lessons/[lessonId]/page.tsx` — passes `lesson.transcript_content` through to `Lesson360VideoPlayer` (Lesson type already had `transcript_content` from plan 23).

**No migration. No new env vars. No new packages.** Typecheck clean.

**Behavior delivered:**

- A 360° video lesson whose `transcript_content` JSONB is populated now shows a document-icon toggle in the top-right of the player. Tapping it slides out the shared transcript panel below the player.
- Active segment highlights in fuchsia and auto-scrolls into view as the video plays (same behavior as flat video).
- Clicking a transcript segment calls `VideoPlugin.setTime(segment.startTime)`, seeking the 360° video to that timestamp. The pan orientation is preserved (learner stays looking at the same point in the scene).
- `VideoPlayer` and `AudioPlayer` continue to behave identically to before this branch, just with less code duplication.

**Impact on other plans:**

- Plan 25 (offline caching) — the shared TranscriptPanel is a natural candidate for caching alongside the media; worth a mention in plan 25's validation.
- Plan 27 (media library) — unaffected.
- Plan 29 (error handling) — TranscriptPanel is a leaf component with no error paths beyond parent props; no change needed.

### Remaining backlog (unchanged priorities)

- Plan 25 (offline) — medium, ~1 week
- Plan 27 (media library) — large, ~2 weeks
- Plan 29 (error handling UX) — medium
- Plan 26 (Insta360) — blocked on §3 research

## 8. Plan 29 shipped — `feat/error-handling-ux` (`41ea63a`)

Committed 2026-04-16. Awaiting user merge to `main`.

**Files changed (7 files, +512 / −12 lines):**

- `app/error.tsx` (new) — client error boundary catching uncaught errors below `/app`. Branded card with "Try again" (calls `reset()`) + "Go home" actions, shows Next.js error digest.
- `app/global-error.tsx` (new) — last-resort boundary for errors inside the root layout. Dependency-free, inline styles only (globals.css may not have loaded when this fires).
- `app/academy/error.tsx` (new) — academy-specific boundary with "Your progress is safe" copy and "Back to Academy" link. Takes precedence over `app/error.tsx` for `/academy/*`.
- `app/dashboard/error.tsx` (new) — dashboard-specific boundary using the dark palette so dashboard pages don't flash from dark to light on error.
- `lib/error-logging.ts` (new) — single `logError(err, { module, digest, context })` entry point. Dev emits grouped console output; prod emits single-line JSON prefixed `[centos-error]` for log aggregators. One place to add Sentry later.
- `components/ui/ToastProvider.tsx` (new) — custom lightweight toast system. `useToast()` hook exposes `success` / `error` / `info` / `dismiss`. Success + info auto-dismiss after 5s; errors stick (users need to actually read them). `aria-live="polite"`; error-kind toasts get `role="alert"`.
- `app/layout.tsx` — wraps children in `<ToastProvider>`; tightens the Umami analytics script condition so `/a/script.js` only mounts when `NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_SCRIPT_URL` or `UMAMI_HOST_URL` is set (previously it mounted whenever the site ID was present, causing the `/a/script.js` and `/a/api/send` 404s in dev).

**Existing `app/not-found.tsx` was adequate and was left untouched.**

### Behavior delivered

- Any uncaught error below `/app/` renders the branded `app/error.tsx` recovery surface instead of a black screen. Academy routes get the academy-specific version; dashboard routes get the dark-themed version.
- Errors in the root layout itself fall through to `app/global-error.tsx` with inline styles, so the UI still comes up even if globals.css or the layout provider tree is broken.
- Every boundary logs the error through the shared `logError` helper so future Sentry integration is a one-file change.
- Toast system is mounted globally; any client component can now call `useToast()` and surface success/error/info messages without writing a mini-provider per feature.
- Umami analytics 404 noise in dev is gone — the script only mounts when there's actually somewhere for it to go.

### Impact on other plans

- **Plan 27 (media library)** — can use `useToast()` for upload/delete/replace feedback without wiring its own notification layer.
- **Plan 25 (offline caching)** — failed fetches should call `useToast().error('You\u2019re offline')` for instant feedback.
- **All future features** — use `logError()` instead of bare `console.error()` so production logs stay greppable.

### Follow-up work (not in this branch)

- A global CSS rewrite returning 204 for `/a/script.js` would be belt-and-suspenders for the analytics suppression. The `next.config.mjs` approach wasn't strictly needed once the layout condition was tightened — the 404 no longer happens.
- `useToast()` adoption sweep: replace scattered `console.error` + silent-catch patterns across the app with toasts. Follow-up branch after this ships.

### Remaining backlog (unchanged priorities)

- Plan 25 (offline) — medium, ~1 week
- Plan 27 (media library) — large, ~2 weeks
- Plan 26 (Insta360) — blocked on §3 research

## 9. Plan 27a shipped — `feat/academy-media-library-foundation` (`4056efb`)

Committed 2026-04-16. Awaiting user merge to `main`. **Migration 180 must run after merge.**

Plan 27 split into two branches per the plan's own guidance; this is 27a (foundation). Plan 27b (search + tags + picker) is the next queued item.

**Files changed (10 files, +935 / −1 lines):**

- `supabase/migrations/180_media_assets.sql` (new) — `media_assets` table keyed by `(owner_id, cloudinary_public_id)`. `pg_trgm` extension + GIN indexes on `name` (trigram) and `tags` so plan 27b's fuzzy search already has its indexes. RLS: owner-only.
- `lib/academy/media-types.ts` (new) — `MediaAsset`, `MediaAssetReference`, `AssetKind` types.
- `app/api/academy/media/route.ts` (new) — GET list (owner-scoped, optional `kind` filter), POST upsert on `(owner_id, public_id)`.
- `app/api/academy/media/[id]/route.ts` (new) — PATCH name/description/tags, DELETE with 409 + reference count when any lesson still uses the URL.
- `app/api/academy/media/[id]/references/route.ts` (new) — lists lessons referencing the asset via `content_url` or `video_360_poster_url`, each tagged with the matching field.
- `app/dashboard/teaching/media/page.tsx` (new) — mount point.
- `components/academy/media-library/MediaLibrary.tsx` (new) — top-level container with list/select/save/delete/references wiring; uses `useToast()` for user-visible errors and `logError()` for structured logging.
- `components/academy/media-library/MediaGrid.tsx` (new) — responsive 2/3/4-column thumbnail grid. Image/panorama_image show their own URL; videos show the Cloudinary `so_0` first-frame transform; audio/document/other get icon tiles.
- `components/academy/media-library/MediaDetailPanel.tsx` (new) — right-side panel with editable name/description/tags, read-only metadata, Cloudinary link, collapsible "Lessons using this asset" (lazy-loaded), delete with explicit "Cloudinary file untouched" note.
- `components/academy/Cloudinary360Uploader.tsx` — fire-and-forget POST to `/api/academy/media` after a successful upload. Failures are swallowed + logged via `logError` so they never block the lesson save path. Existing `onUploadSuccess` callback signature is unchanged — no caller edits needed.

### Behavior delivered

- Every 360° upload a teacher makes through `Cloudinary360Uploader` now registers automatically in the library with filename, dimensions, duration, and byte size. Existing 360° lessons that uploaded before this branch won't retroactively appear (one-time backfill is a separate task if you want it).
- Navigating to `/dashboard/teaching/media` shows the library as a grid of thumbnails. Click a tile → right-side panel opens with the full asset details.
- Rename an asset ("IMG_20260411_143022_001" → "Main hall walkthrough"), add a description and tags, save → the grid tile updates.
- Delete an asset with no references → gone. Delete one that's referenced → blocked with "Can't delete — this asset is referenced by N lessons. Unwire those lessons first."
- "Lessons using this asset" expands into a clickable list of the exact lesson + course pairs, each tagged content/poster so the teacher knows where to find it.
- All error paths toast via `useToast()` (plan 29's system) and log structured via `logError()` — zero bare `console.error()` calls.

### Plan 27b (deferred to next branch)

- **Fuzzy search** — Fuse.js over name + description + tags. Indexes already exist in the DB; 27b just needs the client integration and a search bar in the library header.
- **Tag filter chips** — clickable chips in the header that narrow the grid to assets carrying the selected tag(s).
- **"Pick from library" button** — new flow in the CurriculumTab URL input for 360° lesson types. Opens a `MediaPickerModal` that reuses the grid + search.
- **Replace-file action** — upload a new version of an existing asset; all referring lessons auto-pick-up the new URL via `media_assets` join (design decision pending — simpler path may be to keep the public_id stable and overwrite, so content_url doesn't even need to change).

### Merge order

1. Merge `feat/error-handling-ux` (`41ea63a`) first — media library imports `useToast` and `logError` from it.
2. Merge `feat/academy-media-library-foundation` (`4056efb`).
3. Run `psql ... -f supabase/migrations/180_media_assets.sql`.
4. Visit `/dashboard/teaching/media` — empty state.
5. Upload a 360° asset via any existing lesson → refresh the library page → the asset appears.

---

## 10. Plan 27b shipped — `feat/academy-media-library-search-picker` (`fa5f4cf`)

Committed 2026-04-16. Awaiting user merge to `main`. **Run `npm install` from a working network before merging** — the school Lightspeed filter blocked `fuse.js` the same way it blocked PSV plugins during plan 23a. Package.json references the dep; a local type shim keeps `tsc` green until the real package lands.

Plan 27 is now fully shipped (27a foundation + 27b this branch).

**Files changed (7 files, +484 / −8 lines):**

- `lib/academy/media-search.ts` (new) — `filterAssets(assets, query, tags)` combines AND-tag-filter with fuzzy Fuse.js search over name/description/tags. `uniqueTags()` returns the sorted distinct set. Threshold 0.4, minMatchCharLength 2, ignoreLocation — tuned for a teacher's library of a few hundred files.
- `components/academy/media-library/MediaFilterBar.tsx` (new) — shared search input + tag chip row. Controlled props so MediaLibrary and MediaPickerModal each own their own filter state independently. `aria-live` on the result-count so screen readers pick up filtering.
- `components/academy/media-library/MediaPickerModal.tsx` (new) — reusable modal wrapping the grid + filter bar. Accepts `allowedKinds` to pre-filter (e.g. `['panorama_video']` for a 360° video lesson). Fires `onPick(asset)` with the full `MediaAsset`; caller handles state change + close.
- `types/fuse-js-shim.d.ts` (new) — local module shim. Same dev-network workaround as plan 23a's PSV shim. Delete once `npm install` lands the real types.
- `components/academy/media-library/MediaLibrary.tsx` — adds `query` + `selectedTags` state, wires `MediaFilterBar`, uses `filterAssets()` to drive the grid. Empty-filter-result renders a dashed placeholder.
- `components/academy/course-editor/CurriculumTab.tsx` — single `pickerState` drives one `MediaPickerModal` shared across all four 360° upload sites (add × video, add × photo, edit × video, edit × photo). "Pick from library" button renders next to each `Cloudinary360Uploader` for 360° lesson types. Picking sets both `content_url` and the derived `video_360_poster_url`.
- `package.json` — adds `fuse.js` at `^7.0.0`.

### Behavior delivered

- The library page header now has a search input (name + description + tags, fuzzy) and a row of clickable tag chips. Both filters compose — search inside a tag-filtered subset. "Clear filters" link appears when any filter is active and the result count differs from the total.
- In the teacher course editor, every 360° upload site (add/edit × video/photo) has a new **"Pick from library"** button below the Cloudinary upload button. Clicking opens a modal with the library pre-filtered to matching `asset_kind` (`panorama_video` or `panorama_image`). Pick → modal closes → the lesson's content_url + poster fill in.
- The picker is the fast path to reuse: a teacher with 30 MUCHO Museo panoramas can now stamp any of them into a new lesson without re-uploading.

### Merge order (updated)

1. **Run `npm install` from home** to pull `fuse.js`. Confirm `node_modules/fuse.js` exists before pushing the merge.
2. Merge `fa5f4cf` to `main`.
3. Delete `types/fuse-js-shim.d.ts` in a tiny follow-up `chore/` commit once `npm ls fuse.js` confirms the real package is present.

### Plan 27 follow-ups NOT in this branch

- **Replace-file action** — upload a new version of an existing asset. Options: (a) overwrite Cloudinary at same public_id so URL stays stable and referring lessons auto-pickup, (b) new public_id + UPDATE all referring lesson rows in a transaction. Deferred; low-priority until a teacher asks.
- **Kind filter in UI** — the API already supports `?kind=`; the library page doesn't expose a UI control. Add if teachers with mixed libraries ask.
- **Chip-input for tags** — plan 27a's detail panel uses a comma-separated text input. Parse-on-Enter chip-input would be nicer polish.

### Remaining backlog

| Plan | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 25 (offline) | 25a shipped; 25b queued | 25a in §11 below. |
| 26 (Insta360) | blocked | §3 research required. |

---

## 11. Plan 25a shipped — `feat/academy-360-offline-foundation` (`39bc60a`)

Committed 2026-04-16. Awaiting user merge to `main`. **Migration 181 must run after merge.**

Plan 25 split into 25a (foundation — IndexedDB blob cache, player resolver, per-asset save) shipping now, plus 25b (Service Worker shell cache, full-course batch save, storage manager, enrollment-revocation purge) queued.

### Commit chain update

| Commit | Branch | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `39bc60a` | `feat/academy-360-offline-foundation` | IndexedDB blob cache + save-per-asset + player resolver for 360° |

**Files changed (8 files, +525 / −15 lines):**

- `supabase/migrations/181_offline_assets.sql` (new) — `offline_assets` ledger table. Server tracks what each user has cached; bytes live in the browser.
- `lib/offline/blob-store.ts` (new) — raw IndexedDB wrapper (no `idb` package — school network workaround). `putBlob` / `getBlob` / `deleteBlob` / `listBlobs` / `totalCachedBytes` / `downloadAndCache`. SSR-safe.
- `lib/offline/asset-resolver.ts` (new) — `resolveAssetUrl(url)` returns a `blob:` URL if cached, the original URL otherwise. `releaseResolvedUrl` to revoke on cleanup.
- `app/api/offline/assets/route.ts` (new) — GET list, POST upsert on `(user_id, asset_url)`, DELETE by `{ asset_url }`.
- `components/academy/SaveOfflineButton.tsx` (new) — per-asset toggle with three states: uncached / downloading / cached-with-remove. Pre-flight `navigator.storage.estimate()` quota check hard-refuses below 200 MB free.
- `components/academy/Lesson360VideoPlayer.tsx` — calls `resolveAssetUrl(src)` before PSV init. Plays from blob URL when cached.
- `components/academy/Lesson360PhotoPlayer.tsx` — same resolver integration.
- `app/academy/[courseId]/lessons/[lessonId]/page.tsx` — renders `<SaveOfflineButton>` below the player for 360° lesson types. `dynamic({ ssr: false })` since it touches IndexedDB.

### Behavior delivered

- Every 360° video or photo lesson has a **"Save for offline"** button below the player. Click once → downloads the blob into IndexedDB + registers in the server ledger. Button turns green with a checkmark ("Saved offline") + a trash icon to remove.
- Subsequent visits to that lesson: the player resolves the content URL to the cached blob and streams locally. Works with network disabled.
- Hard-refuse when the browser reports less than 200 MB free so a blown-quota save doesn't leave a half-downloaded blob.
- All error paths toast via `useToast()` (plan 29); all logs structured via `logError()`.

### Plan 25b (queued for next branch)

- **Service Worker** — cache the learner route HTML/JS/CSS so the lesson page itself loads offline (right now only media is cached; the shell still needs network).
- **"Save course for offline"** button on course detail page. Batch-downloads every 360° asset across every lesson in the course.
- **Storage management UI** in account settings — total cached size, per-course breakdown, per-asset list, "clear all offline data" action.
- **Enrollment-revocation purge** — when an enrollment goes inactive (Stripe cancellation, teacher revoke), the next app load reads the user's ledger for that course and deletes the corresponding blobs.
- **iOS Safari validation pass** — real-device test with 50 MB and 150 MB blobs per the plan §11 checklist.

### Merge order

1. Merge `39bc60a` to `main`.
2. Run `psql ... -f supabase/migrations/181_offline_assets.sql`.
3. Open a 360° lesson → click "Save for offline" → confirm green "Saved offline" state.
4. DevTools → Network → Offline → refresh → lesson should still play.
5. DevTools → Application → IndexedDB → `centos-offline` DB should contain the blob keyed by its Cloudinary URL.

### Remaining backlog

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| 25b (offline shell + course save + manager) | next |
| 26 (Insta360 import) | blocked on §3 research |

---

## 12. Plan 25b shipped — `feat/academy-360-offline-manager` (`4f180f1`)

Batch save + storage management. Sits on top of 25a's per-asset plumbing so a learner can save a whole 360° course in one click and see (or reclaim) what's on the device.

**Scope split:** 25b = course-level save + storage manager; **25c (deferred)** = Service Worker shell cache, enrollment-revocation purge, iOS Safari validation pass.

### Files added

- `lib/offline/storage-usage.ts` — merges IndexedDB blob inventory + `/api/offline/assets` ledger into grouped-by-course view. Exposes `getStorageSummary()`, `purgeAsset()`, `purgeCourseGroup()`, and a `formatBytes` helper. Surfaces drift (orphan blobs / orphan ledger) so the UI can offer cleanup.
- `components/academy/offline/OfflineStorageManager.tsx` — learner-facing UI. Per-course sections, per-asset rows with filename + kind + size, per-asset and per-course trash actions. Top card shows `navigator.storage.estimate()` quota with color-coded progress bar (sky/amber/red at 65/85%).
- `app/academy/offline/page.tsx` — hosts the manager at `/academy/offline`.
- `components/academy/offline/SaveCourseOfflineButton.tsx` — course-level batch download. Walks the lesson list sequentially (no parallel — 100+ MB videos would thrash), writes blobs + posts ledger rows, shows progress bar + cancel button. Pre-flight refuses when storage headroom < max(250 MB, 1.25× guess).

### Files modified

- `app/academy/[courseId]/page.tsx` — computes `offlineAssets` (360° + posters) for enrolled, unlocked lessons and renders `<SaveCourseOfflineButton>` next to the curriculum heading. `Lesson` interface gained `content_url` + `video_360_poster_url`.
- `app/academy/my-courses/page.tsx` — "Offline storage" button top-right linking to `/academy/offline`.

### Behavior delivered

- Enrolled learners see **"Save all N lessons for offline"** above the curriculum. Click → sequential download with "Saving lesson X of N — X.Y MB" progress and a cancel button. Cancellation is clean (AbortController + flag) and preserves already-downloaded assets as a resumable partial state.
- When every asset is already cached, the button collapses to a green "All N assets saved offline" pill + "Manage offline storage" link.
- `/academy/offline` shows total cached bytes, browser quota bar, and every cached asset grouped by course (with course titles looked up via `/api/academy/my-courses`). Orphans (blob-without-ledger, ledger-without-blob) call themselves out with an amber banner and can be purged from the same rows.
- `purgeAsset()` + `purgeCourseGroup()` delete from both client IDB and server ledger via `Promise.allSettled` so a single-side failure doesn't wedge the row.
- All errors route through `useToast()` + `logError()` (plan 29).

### Merge order

1. Merge `4f180f1` to `main`.
2. No new migration — reuses 181 (offline_assets) from plan 25a.
3. As enrolled learner: open a course with 360° lessons → click "Save all" → confirm progress bar + eventual green all-cached state.
4. `/academy/offline` → confirm course group shows every cached asset + correct total → click "Remove all" → rows disappear.
5. DevTools → Application → IndexedDB → `centos-offline` → blobs deleted after purge.
6. Quota bar: visible on browsers that implement `navigator.storage.estimate()` (Chromium + recent Safari).

### Plan 25c (deferred follow-ups)

- **Service Worker** for the learner route shell (HTML/JS/CSS) so the page itself loads fully offline — today only media is cached.
- **Enrollment-revocation purge** — when an enrollment goes inactive, next app load reads the user's ledger for that course and deletes the blobs automatically.
- **iOS Safari validation** — real-device test with 50 MB + 150 MB panorama videos per plan 25 §11 checklist.

### Remaining backlog

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| 25c (SW shell + revocation purge + iOS validation) | next |
| 26 (Insta360 import) | blocked on §3 research |

---

## 13. Plan 25c shipped — `feat/academy-360-offline-service-worker` (`a4e12c8`)

Finishes the offline trilogy. Turns out the Service Worker half was already in place from earlier site-wide work, so the substantive new code is the enrollment-revocation purge; iOS validation stays a manual sign-off.

### Pre-existing, confirmed adequate for plan 25c

- `public/sw.js` — `CACHE_VERSION = 'centos-v5'`, handles navigation (network-first with `/offline.html` fallback), static assets (cache-first), and API (stale-while-revalidate). Registered in production by `components/ServiceWorkerRegistration.tsx` from the root layout. No bump needed — the SW has no offline-plan-specific logic that needs updating.
- `public/offline.html` — minimal branded fallback page; copy already makes sense for academy users ("Previously visited pages are still available").

### Files added

- `app/api/offline/assets/purge-revoked/route.ts` — POST endpoint. Server computes the set difference `(user's ledger rows with course_id) ∖ (user's active enrollments)` and deletes those rows. Returns `{ revoked_urls, count }` so the client can mirror the purge into IndexedDB. Trust boundary sits on the server — the ledger is authoritative; the client is untrusted.
- `lib/offline/purge-revoked.ts` — `purgeRevoked()` wraps the endpoint and fans the returned URLs into `deleteBlob(url)` calls via `Promise.allSettled`. Failed local deletes show up later as orphan blobs in the storage manager, which is fine.
- `components/academy/offline/RevokedAssetsPurger.tsx` — invisible mount component. Runs once per SPA session (module-level flag de-dupes across academy navigations), waits 1.5s so it doesn't compete with auth/enrollment mount-time work, and toasts the user when any lessons were removed so the shrink isn't silent.

### Files modified

- `app/academy/layout.tsx` — mounts `<RevokedAssetsPurger />`. Non-academy surfaces keep zero overhead.

### Behavior delivered

- When a teacher revokes a student's enrollment (or a Stripe subscription cancels, or the student unenrolls themselves), the student's next visit to any `/academy/*` page triggers an auto-purge. Ledger rows vanish server-side immediately; matching IndexedDB blobs are deleted client-side a second later.
- User sees a gentle info toast: "Removed N offline lessons from courses you no longer have access to." — no modal, no blocker, just a notice.
- Re-enrolling in the same course after revocation lets them re-save lessons normally. Cache key is the Cloudinary URL, so if the teacher hasn't replaced the media, a fresh save is a no-op download (browser HTTP cache may even serve it instantly).
- Rows with `course_id = null` (posters unlinked from a lesson, stray uploads) are never auto-purged — enrollment gating doesn't apply to them. Users can still purge manually in the storage manager.

### What's NOT in this branch (out of scope for a code-only plan)

- **iOS Safari real-device validation** — `plans/validate/25-academy-360-offline.md §11` already lists the exact checklist (50 MB video, 150 MB video, safari close/reopen, cross-domain navigation). Needs real hardware, sign off after merge.
- **Periodic orphan URL cleanup** — `plan 25 §10`: when a teacher replaces a lesson's `content_url`, the old ledger row becomes orphaned (no lesson references it). Out of scope here — the storage manager already flags these for user cleanup and a background cron is overkill for v1.

### Merge order

1. Merge `a4e12c8` to `main` (depends on `4f180f1` from plan 25b — merge that first if not already).
2. No new migration. Reuses 181 (offline_assets).
3. As enrolled student: save a 360° lesson offline → confirm blob + ledger exist.
4. As admin/teacher: `UPDATE enrollments SET status='cancelled' WHERE user_id=...` for that student's row (or cancel via the teacher UI if it exists).
5. As the student: reload any `/academy/*` page → within ~2 s, see the "Removed N offline lessons…" toast. IndexedDB + ledger should both be empty for that course.
6. Re-enroll → `SaveCourseOfflineButton` appears again and works.

### Remaining backlog

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| 25 iOS validation pass | open — needs device |
| 26 (Insta360 import) | blocked on §3 research |

---

## 14. Plan 26 research brief — `research/academy-insta360-import` (`2ac89b2`)

Not code. Desk research answering three of four §3 questions from [plan 26](../26-academy-insta360-import.md) using public Insta360 documentation and GitHub repos. Brief lives at [plans/26-academy-insta360-import-research.md](../26-academy-insta360-import-research.md).

### Findings at a glance

| §3 question | Answer | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Public SDK / documented file format? | **Yes.** Self-service application, ~3 business day approval. | High |
| 2. Mobile share path from Insta360 app? | **No.** Hardcoded YouTube/Facebook/Street View only; no OS share sheet, no URL scheme. | High |
| 3. NDA or commercial licensing? | No public evidence. Need direct confirmation for commercial SaaS redistribution. | Medium |
| 4. Insta360 dominant among our teachers? | **Unknown — needs survey.** | — |

### What's in the brief

- **Findings for §3.1–§3.3** with source links (insta360.com/developer, onlinemanual.insta360.com, github.com/Insta360Develop).
- **Devrel email draft** — three short questions covering the remaining commercial-terms gap. Ready to paste into a mail client, fill `{Name}`/`{Title}`, and send.
- **Teacher-camera survey** — 5 questions with decision thresholds: >60% Insta360 → pursue full plan 26 (desktop-only); 40–60% → smaller v1 only; <40% → cancel plan 26 proper.
- **Decision tree** mapping survey outcomes to action.

### Key discovery: mobile path is dead

Plan 26 §2 assumed a "Continue in CentenarianOS" deep-link from the Insta360 app's share menu. Insta360's app does not expose an OS share sheet or custom URL scheme — only hardcoded destinations. **Any mobile path requires users to export to Photos/Files first, which is the flow they already have.** If plan 26 proceeds at all, it's desktop-only.

### Key discovery: desktop integration is a native-companion project

The SDK doesn't expose a web/browser runtime. A real integration means shipping a native companion (Electron / Tauri) that uses the C++ CameraSDK to read Insta360 Studio exports and pipe them through our Cloudinary flow. That's a quarter-plus of work we haven't scoped — **if the survey unblocks the plan, we'd need to revisit prioritization before committing.**

### Recommended immediate action

Ship the **§4 smaller v1** (aspect-ratio warn + filename pattern title suggestion) on a separate branch. It's ~1 hour of work, zero external dependencies, valuable regardless of survey outcome. Run the survey and email devrel in parallel.

### Next human actions

1. Send the devrel email drafted in brief §4.
2. Launch the 5-question teacher survey (brief §5).
3. Greenlight the §4 smaller v1 branch independently.

Research phase is complete once the email is sent and the survey is live.

### Remaining backlog (updated)

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| 25 iOS validation pass | open — needs device |
| 26.0 smaller v1 (aspect ratio + filename hints) | ready — ~1 hour |
| 26 full (desktop native companion) | blocked on survey + devrel reply |
| 26 mobile deep-link | **cancelled** — Insta360 app doesn't expose it |

---

## 15. Plan 26.0 shipped — `feat/academy-360-upload-hints` (`6966c6b`)

The research-brief §4 smaller v1. Brand-agnostic upload quality-of-life that doesn't depend on any external research outcome.

### Files added

- `lib/academy/camera-filename.ts` — pattern matcher that recognizes common 360° camera filenames and produces a suggested lesson title:
  - Insta360 X/ONE X video: `VID_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_XX_XXX` → "Insta360 recording — {formatted date}"
  - Insta360 photo: `IMG_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_XX` → "Insta360 photo — {formatted date}"
  - GoPro Max: `GS######` → "GoPro Max recording"
  - Ricoh Theta (new): `R#####` → "Ricoh Theta recording"
  - Ricoh Theta (old, date-based): `yymmddhhmmss` → "Ricoh Theta — {date}"
  - Also exports `checkEquirectangularRatio(width, height)` returning `'ok' | 'suspect' | null` for the 2:1 check.

### Files modified

- `components/academy/Cloudinary360Uploader.tsx` — new `onTitleSuggestion` callback. After a successful upload, inspects `info.width / info.height` and shows a non-blocking amber warning if the ratio isn't in [1.95, 2.05] ("This file is W×H (X.YZ:1). Equirectangular 360° media should be 2:1 — export the stitched version from your camera's desktop app and re-upload."). Parses `info.original_filename` through `suggestTitleFromFilename` and fires the callback when a pattern matches.
- `components/academy/course-editor/CurriculumTab.tsx` — passes `onTitleSuggestion` into all four upload sites (edit/new × video/photo). Handler only applies the suggestion when the current title is empty, so teacher input is never clobbered.

### Why non-blocking on the ratio check

Half-sphere (180° VR180) and partial-sphere content is legitimately not 2:1 but still valuable. Raw dual-fisheye INSV files are 2:1 (two circles side by side) and would pass the ratio check despite being unplayable — so the ratio check alone isn't sufficient to guarantee equirectangular. We warn rather than reject so teachers can self-diagnose the "stretched / frozen preview" failure mode without being blocked when they know what they're doing.

### Verification

1. Open teacher course editor → add new lesson → pick 360 video type.
2. Upload a real Insta360 export (e.g. `VID_20260411_143022_00_012.mp4`). The lesson title should auto-fill "Insta360 recording — {date}" if it was blank; an existing title is preserved.
3. Upload a non-equirectangular file (e.g. a plain 16:9 MP4 — the widget rejects-not-equirectangular formats client-side but if you paste a Cloudinary URL directly, the check would only trigger via the upload path). Amber warning banner appears under the upload button.
4. Type a title first, then upload → title stays as typed.

### Remaining backlog (unchanged from §14 except 26.0 status)

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| 25 iOS validation pass | open — needs device |
| 26.0 smaller v1 | **shipped** (this branch) |
| 26 full (desktop native companion) | blocked on survey + devrel reply |
| 26 mobile deep-link | cancelled |

## 16. Starter tier design — `docs/starter-tier-access-design` (pre-code)

Design artifact, not code. Answers the key question: **how does the app restrict a Starter (pick-3) user to their chosen modules?** Also adds STYLE_GUIDE §5a codifying the "report-per-branch" rule.

Plan source: [plans/future/starter-tier-plan.md](../future/starter-tier-plan.md). This design doc converts it into a concrete access-control architecture before any code lands.

**Pricing (owner-confirmed, 2026-04-16):**
- Monthly: **$5.46/mo** (net $5 after Stripe fees) — env: `STRIPE_STARTER_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID`
- Annual: **$51.80/yr** (net $50 after Stripe fees) — env: `STRIPE_STARTER_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID`
- Annual savings: $65.52 (12 × monthly) − $51.80 = **$13.72/yr, ~21% off**
- Consistent with owner's "price net-of-Stripe-fees" pricing convention for all products.

All prices are **same modules, same gates** — only the billing cadence differs. The Pick-3 constraint applies identically to both.

### 16.1 — The good news: the enforcement primitive already exists

`app/dashboard/layout.tsx:54-102` already implements **exactly** the pattern we need, just under a different name. The "invited user" flow stores an array of allowed route prefixes in `profiles.invite_modules`, and the dashboard layout redirects users hitting a route not in that list. Starter tier is the same mechanism with a different source of truth — we reuse it verbatim.

Current flow for invited users:
1. `/api/auth/me` reads `profiles.invite_modules` and returns it as `inviteModules`.
2. Dashboard layout sets `allowedModules = isInvited && !isPaid && !isAdmin ? inviteModules : null`.
3. Redirect effect: if `allowedModules && !isFreeRoute(pathname)` and the current path isn't in the list, `router.push('/dashboard/planner')`.
4. `components/nav/NavConfig.ts:126-140` exports `getVisibleGroups(isAdmin, allowedModules)` which filters nav items client-side so users never see links to forbidden modules.

**We extend this path, we do not rebuild it.**

### 16.2 — Data model

Single migration (sequential with existing numbering — next available is `182` per [MEMORY.md](../../../.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md) noting `181_offline_assets.sql` was last):

```sql
-- 182_starter_tier.sql
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS selected_modules TEXT[];

-- Drop + re-add the CHECK constraint on subscription_status to allow 'starter'
ALTER TABLE public.profiles DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS profiles_subscription_status_check;
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ADD CONSTRAINT profiles_subscription_status_check
  CHECK (subscription_status IN ('free', 'monthly', 'lifetime', 'starter'));

COMMENT ON COLUMN public.profiles.selected_modules IS
  'Starter-tier users: array of module slugs they picked at checkout (max 3). NULL for all other tiers.';
```

TEXT[] rather than JSONB because we only store a flat array of strings and want Postgres-native array ops (`ANY`, `contains`) if we ever query "which users have module X selected".

### 16.3 — Module → route-prefix mapping

A Starter user picks **3 modules from 8**, but the layout enforces **route prefixes**. Each pickable module maps to one or more top-level dashboard routes. Mapping verified against the actual directory listing in `app/dashboard/`. Sub-routes are included automatically because the layout uses `pathname.startsWith(prefix + '/')`.

**Always-included (for Starter and every other tier) — don't count toward the 3:**

| Route | Reason |
|---|---|
| `/dashboard/planner`, `/dashboard/weekly-review`, `/dashboard/retrospective` | Owner decision 2026-04-16: Planner is universal baseline. |
| `/dashboard/roadmap` | Same — paired with Planner. |
| `/academy` | Decision C: Academy (student) always included; teachers bring content, platform takes fees on paid courses. |
| `/dashboard/categories` | Decision B: Life Categories unrestricted — makes every other module better, doesn't make sense as a separate gate. |
| `/dashboard/data` | Decision A: **full import/export unrestricted**. Users can export their entire data set — including modules they don't currently have access to. This is a data-rights call: locking someone out of their own data on downgrade is hostile. |
| `/dashboard/blog`, `/dashboard/recipes`, `/dashboard/discover`, `/dashboard/billing`, `/dashboard/messages`, `/dashboard/feedback`, `/dashboard/settings`, `/dashboard/teaching` | Existing `FREE_ROUTE_PREFIXES` in `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`. |

**Pickable modules (Starter picks 3 from 8):**

```ts
// lib/access/starter-modules.ts
export type ModuleSlug =
  | 'engine' | 'fuel' | 'metrics' | 'workouts'
  | 'finance' | 'travel' | 'equipment' | 'correlations';

export const STARTER_MODULES: Record<ModuleSlug, {
  label: string;
  prefixes: string[];
  description: string;
  icon: string;
}> = {
  engine:       { label: 'Engine',         prefixes: ['/dashboard/engine'],                               description: 'Focus sessions, analytics, doodle canvas',                    icon: 'Briefcase' },
  fuel:         { label: 'Fuel',           prefixes: ['/dashboard/fuel', '/dashboard/scan'],              description: 'Supplement protocols, daily fuel logs, ingredient scan',      icon: 'Utensils' },
  metrics:      { label: 'Health Metrics', prefixes: ['/dashboard/metrics'],                              description: 'RHR, steps, sleep, body composition, wearable sync',          icon: 'HeartPulse' },
  workouts:     { label: 'Workouts',       prefixes: ['/dashboard/workouts', '/dashboard/exercises'],     description: 'Exercise library, templates, logs, Nomad OS',                 icon: 'Dumbbell' },
  finance:      { label: 'Finance',        prefixes: ['/dashboard/finance'],                              description: 'Transactions, accounts, budgets, invoices, forecast',         icon: 'DollarSign' },
  travel:       { label: 'Travel',         prefixes: ['/dashboard/travel'],                               description: 'Trips, vehicles, fuel logs, maintenance, routes',             icon: 'Navigation' },
  equipment:    { label: 'Equipment',      prefixes: ['/dashboard/equipment', '/dashboard/media'],        description: 'Asset tracking, valuations, media library & gallery',        icon: 'Package' },
  correlations: { label: 'Correlations',   prefixes: ['/dashboard/correlations', '/dashboard/analytics'], description: 'Cross-module analytics, AI insights',                         icon: 'TrendingUp' },
};

export const STARTER_ALWAYS_INCLUDED_PREFIXES = [
  '/dashboard/planner',
  '/dashboard/weekly-review',
  '/dashboard/retrospective',
  '/dashboard/roadmap',
  '/academy',
  '/dashboard/categories',
  '/dashboard/data',
];

export function expandToPrefixes(slugs: string[]): string[] {
  const picked = slugs.flatMap((slug) => STARTER_MODULES[slug as ModuleSlug]?.prefixes ?? []);
  return [...STARTER_ALWAYS_INCLUDED_PREFIXES, ...picked];
}
```

**Bundled decisions (not asking):**
- Scan bundles with Fuel (scan reads ingredients / supplement labels — only useful alongside fuel logging).
- Media library bundles with Equipment (primary consumer — equipment media gallery is the heaviest user).
- Exercises bundles with Workouts (library is the builder surface for workouts).
- Analytics bundles with Correlations (same cross-module analytics surface).

### 16.4 — Enforcement: three layers, one source of truth

Defense-in-depth. Each layer serves a different purpose; they are not redundant.

| Layer | Where | Purpose | Bypass if broken |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Nav filter (UX)** | `NavConfig.getVisibleGroups(isAdmin, allowedPrefixes)` — already supports this signature | Users never see links to modules they can't access. Removes confusion. | User could still type `/dashboard/finance` into the address bar. |
| **2. Dashboard layout redirect (gate)** | `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` existing `useEffect` that redirects invited users — extend the condition to also run for Starter users | Authoritative access gate. Even a user who types the URL directly gets bounced. | Client-only; could theoretically be bypassed with JS disabled, but the APIs still enforce RLS. |
| **3. Dashboard index redirect (fallback)** | `app/dashboard/page.tsx` — when redirecting to default home, land on a selected module if possible | Starter user who'd normally get bounced to `/dashboard/planner` they don't own lands on their first selected module instead. | Cosmetic; layer 2 still catches this. |

**What we deliberately do NOT do:** route-level checks inside each module page. Reason: the dashboard layout already guards the entire dashboard subtree. Scattering access checks across 50+ page.tsx files is a maintenance burden and a footgun (miss one → silent bypass).

**Teaser pages:** when a Starter user tries a forbidden prefix, the layout currently redirects to `/dashboard/planner`. We change that target to a new `/dashboard/upgrade?from=<module>` page that shows:
- "Upgrade to unlock {Module}" headline
- One-click upgrade button (Stripe checkout at Pro / Lifetime price)
- "Or swap a module" link to the module picker

This is a better learner experience than a silent redirect to planner.

### 16.5 — isPaid logic changes

`lib/hooks/useSubscription.ts` currently exports `SubscriptionStatus = 'free' | 'monthly' | 'lifetime'`. Extend:

```ts
export type SubscriptionStatus = 'free' | 'monthly' | 'lifetime' | 'starter';
```

And in `app/dashboard/layout.tsx:47`:

```ts
// Before
const isPaid = subStatus === 'monthly' || subStatus === 'lifetime';

// After
const isPaid = subStatus === 'monthly' || subStatus === 'lifetime' || subStatus === 'starter';
const isStarter = subStatus === 'starter';
// Existing invite logic stays as-is; starter adds a parallel branch.
const allowedModules = isInvited && !isPaid && !isAdmin
  ? inviteModules
  : isStarter && !isAdmin
    ? expandToPrefixes(selectedModules ?? [])
    : null;
```

Admins bypass `allowedModules` entirely (they get the full app regardless of subscription). Lifetime and Monthly users have `allowedModules = null` which unlocks everything.

### 16.6 — Owner decisions (locked in 2026-04-16)

1. **Data Hub (import/export):** **full access, unrestricted.** Owner call — data-rights over product gating. A Starter user can export any data they own, including from modules they no longer have access to. `/dashboard/data` and `/api/*/export` endpoints do not filter by `selected_modules`.
2. **Life Categories:** **unrestricted.** `/dashboard/categories` always included.
3. **Academy (student):** **always included, does not count as 1 of 3.** `/academy` is always accessible. Teachers bring the content; platform revenue comes from fees on paid course enrollments, not from gating student access.
4. **Activity Links across locked modules:** **show + redirect + upgrade CTA.** When a Starter user with Finance (but not Travel) opens an Activity Link picker, Travel entities still appear. Clicking a linked Travel entity redirects to `/dashboard/upgrade?from=travel` which shows the upgrade prompt. Existing links stay visible on source entities (read-only) so the user's prior context isn't lost.

**Additional owner decision:** `/dashboard/planner` and `/dashboard/roadmap` (and the Operate-group sub-tools: weekly-review, retrospective) are **always included for every tier**. They are not part of the 3-picker.

Net effect: Starter picks **3 of 8** modules (Engine, Fuel, Metrics, Workouts, Finance, Travel, Equipment, Correlations). Every other tier gets all of those unrestricted.

### 16.7 — Implementation plan (ordered)

One branch per logical change per STYLE_GUIDE §1. Rough sequencing:

| # | Branch | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `feat/starter-tier-schema` | Migration 182, `SubscriptionStatus` enum, `STARTER_MODULES` map in `lib/access/starter-modules.ts`. No UI changes. |
| 2 | `feat/starter-tier-gating` | Dashboard layout + NavConfig + `/api/auth/me` changes to enforce `allowedModules` for Starter users. Admins tested for regression. |
| 3 | `feat/starter-tier-upgrade-page` | `/dashboard/upgrade` teaser page. Forbidden-module redirects land here. |
| 4 | `feat/starter-tier-module-picker` | Client component on `/pricing` for Starter checkout. Max-3 checkbox grid with descriptions + lock icons. |
| 5 | `feat/starter-tier-stripe` | Both `STRIPE_STARTER_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID` + `STRIPE_STARTER_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID` env vars, checkout route handles `plan=starter-monthly` and `plan=starter-annual` with `selected_modules` metadata, webhook handler writes `subscription_status='starter'` and `profiles.selected_modules`. |
| 6 | `feat/starter-tier-admin-stats` | Admin dashboard: Starter subscriber count + top-3-module-combos widget. |

**Pre-flight gate:** confirm Stripe price creation + env var with owner before branch 5.

### 16.8 — Migration order for merge

1. Land branches in the order above (each PR rebased on the previous if needed).
2. Run `supabase/migrations/182_starter_tier.sql` against production before the branch-5 webhook deployment.
3. Create the Stripe price in dashboard; copy the `price_xxx` into `STRIPE_STARTER_PRICE_ID`.
4. Enable a feature flag `NEXT_PUBLIC_STARTER_TIER_ENABLED=true` (new) on the pricing page so we can stage the rollout.
5. Soft-launch: DM 3 existing free users, walk them through Starter checkout, confirm access behaves as designed.

### 16.9 — Risks + tradeoffs

- **Risk: a Starter user changes their mind and swaps modules, then loses data in a newly-locked module.** Data isn't deleted — only hidden. If they re-select the module later, everything is back. Clarify this in the picker: *"Your data isn't deleted — you can re-select a module anytime."*
- **Tradeoff: Option B (change anytime) from the plan doc wins.** No billing-cycle restriction, no change history. Reason: revenue from Starter is acquisition, not retention-via-lock-in. Friction around swapping modules would tank satisfaction without meaningfully protecting revenue.
- **Risk: cross-app shared DB (see CLAUDE.md).** `selected_modules` column is additive and has no semantic meaning outside CentenarianOS — safe. `subscription_status` gaining `'starter'` is a CHECK constraint change; any other app reading this column will silently ignore unknown values, which is the correct behavior.
- **Risk: feature flag toggled off mid-flight.** If a Starter user is already subscribed when we roll back the flag, they lose access. Mitigation: flag gates the **picker** (checkout path), not the **gating** (already-subscribed users). Users with `subscription_status='starter'` always get their modules regardless of flag state.

### 16.10 — All decisions locked

- ✅ Pricing: $5.46/mo, $51.80/yr (monthly + annual price IDs documented)
- ✅ Access mechanism: extend existing invited-user layer (§16.1, §16.4, §16.5)
- ✅ Data model: migration 182 (§16.2)
- ✅ Module list: 3-from-8 picker + 7 always-included prefixes (§16.3)
- ✅ Four open questions: owner-decided (§16.6)

**No further sign-off needed to open branch 1.** Owner still needs to create the two Stripe prices and share the IDs before branch 5 (Stripe integration) can land — branches 1–4 can proceed without them.

### 16.11 — Ready to code

Next: open `feat/starter-tier-schema` (branch 1 in §16.7), stacked on this design branch.

### Remaining backlog (updated)

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| 25 iOS validation pass | open — needs device |
| 26.0 smaller v1 | shipped |
| 26 full | blocked on survey + devrel reply |
| Starter tier branch 1 | see §17 below |

---

## 17. Starter tier branch 1 shipped — `feat/starter-tier-schema` (pending commit)

Schema + types only. Zero UI, zero behavior changes for existing users. Lays the data-model foundation for branches 2–6 to hang gating and UI off.

### Files added

- `supabase/migrations/182_starter_tier.sql` — adds `profiles.selected_modules TEXT[]` (nullable) and widens the `subscription_status` CHECK to include `'starter'`. Additive — no existing rows need migration, no other app that reads profiles is affected. Column comment documents the pick-3 semantics.
- `lib/access/starter-modules.ts` — the single source of truth for Starter access control. Exports:
  - `ModuleSlug` union of the 8 pickable slugs.
  - `STARTER_PICK_LIMIT = 3`.
  - `STARTER_MODULES` map: each slug → `{ label, prefixes[], description, icon }`. Mirrors §16.3 exactly.
  - `STARTER_ALWAYS_INCLUDED_PREFIXES` array: the 7 paid-tier routes that Starter gets unconditionally (planner family, academy, categories, data).
  - `STARTER_MODULE_SLUGS`, `isModuleSlug`, `expandToPrefixes(slugs)`, `isValidStarterSelection(slugs)` helpers.

### Files modified

- `lib/hooks/useSubscription.ts` — `SubscriptionStatus` gains `'starter'`. `SubscriptionState` gains `selectedModules: string[] | null`. The profile-fetch query selects `selected_modules` and stores it defensively (`Array.isArray(...) ? ... : null`) so a missing column (e.g. during migration rollout) doesn't break the hook.

### Behavior delivered

- **None.** This branch is infrastructure. A user flipping `subscription_status='starter'` directly in the DB would currently get treated as `free` by `isPaid = status === 'monthly' || status === 'lifetime'` (branch 2 changes that). Nothing in the UI exposes the new column.

### Merge order

1. Run `psql ... -f supabase/migrations/182_starter_tier.sql` against the Supabase project.
2. Merge `feat/starter-tier-schema` to `main`.
3. `npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck` before and after — both should return clean (verified in this branch).

### Next branch

Branch 2 — see §18 below.

---

## 18. Starter tier branch 2 shipped — `feat/starter-tier-gating`

Gates. Extends the existing "invited user" access mechanism to cover Starter subscribers. Zero new UI surfaces — just wires the data from branch 1 into the already-built enforcement primitive in `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` and `components/nav/NavConfig.ts`.

### Files modified

- `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`:
  - Imports `expandToPrefixes` from `lib/access/starter-modules.ts`.
  - Reads `selectedModules` from `useSubscription()` (added in branch 1).
  - Extends `isPaid` to include `subStatus === 'starter'`.
  - New `isStarter` boolean derived from `subStatus`.
  - `allowedModules` now resolves as: `null` for admins → `expandToPrefixes(selectedModules)` for Starter → `inviteModules` for invited non-paid non-admin → `null` otherwise.
  - Redirect effect simplified: any user with a non-null `allowedModules` gets redirected off forbidden routes. Single code path covers both Starter and Invited (the two tiers that restrict).

### Files NOT modified (and why)

- `components/nav/NavConfig.ts` — already filters paid items against `allowedModules` with `href === m || href.startsWith(m + '/')`. The existing signature is exactly what Starter users need. Zero changes.
- `app/api/auth/me/route.ts` — subscription data comes through `useSubscription()`, not this endpoint. Keeping the separation: this endpoint is admin/teacher/invited flags; `useSubscription` is subscription tier + selected modules.

### Behavior delivered

- A user with `subscription_status='starter'` and `selected_modules=['finance','workouts','metrics']` can access:
  - All free routes (blog/recipes/billing/messages/feedback/settings/teaching).
  - All always-included paid routes (planner family, academy, categories, data).
  - The three picked module prefixes (finance/*, workouts/* + exercises/*, metrics/*).
  - Every other paid route redirects to `/dashboard/planner` (always-included for Starter, so never loops).
- Nav filters: Starter users don't see links to modules they can't access. Admins + Monthly + Lifetime users see everything (unchanged).
- **Invited-user behavior is unchanged** — the existing `inviteModules` flow still works identically.

### Known edge case (follow-up, not a regression)

A handful of NavConfig entries live under `/dashboard/settings/*` but are marked `paid: true` (e.g., Wearables at `/dashboard/settings/wearables`). The nav filter hides them from Starter/Invited users even when the underlying module is picked (because `/dashboard/settings/wearables` doesn't match any picked prefix). Users can still reach the page by URL because `/dashboard/settings` is in `FREE_ROUTE_PREFIXES`. This is a pre-existing issue that also affected invited users; worth addressing in a NavConfig cleanup branch but out of scope here.

### Merge order

1. Branch 1 (`feat/starter-tier-schema`) must be merged first — this branch depends on `SubscriptionStatus` gaining `'starter'` and `useSubscription` exposing `selectedModules`.
2. Migration 182 must be applied before this branch goes to production (subscription status check rejects 'starter' until it runs).
3. Then merge `feat/starter-tier-gating`.

### Verification

1. Open DB console: `UPDATE profiles SET subscription_status='starter', selected_modules=ARRAY['finance','workouts','metrics'] WHERE id='<your-user-id>';`
2. Refresh dashboard: nav shows only Finance, Workouts, Metrics paid items plus always-included (Planner family, Academy, Categories, Data).
3. Type `/dashboard/travel` → redirects to `/dashboard/planner`.
4. Type `/dashboard/finance` → loads normally.
5. `UPDATE` back to `'free'` → user is kicked to `/pricing`.
6. `UPDATE` to `'monthly'` → full access restored, no restrictions.

### Next branch

Branch 3 — `feat/starter-tier-upgrade-page`. Replaces the redirect target from `/dashboard/planner` to a new `/dashboard/upgrade?from=<module>` page with upgrade CTAs (Monthly / Annual / Lifetime). Same gate, friendlier UX.

### Remaining backlog (updated with plans 30 + 31)

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| 25 iOS validation pass | open — needs device |
| 26.0 smaller v1 | shipped |
| 26 full | blocked on survey + devrel reply |
| **30: Stripe fee calculator** | **new** — see `plans/30-stripe-fee-calculator.md`. Small component, shows live "You receive $X after fees" on every price input. Est ~1–2 hrs. Added per owner request 2026-04-16. |
| **31: i18n (EN + ES) + SEO metadata** | **new** — see `plans/31-i18n-en-es-plus-seo.md`. Phased: Phase 1 infra + pricing/home (1 day), Phase 2 public surfaces (3–5 days), Phase 3 authenticated app (5 days), Phase 4 errors/emails/legal (1–2 days). Added per owner request 2026-04-16. |
| Starter tier branch 3 | next — `/dashboard/upgrade?from=X` page |
| Starter tier branch 4 | pending — module picker on `/pricing` |
| Starter tier branch 5 | pending — Stripe checkout + webhook (needs price IDs) |
| Starter tier branch 6 | pending — admin stats |

---

## 19. Starter tier branch 3 shipped — `feat/starter-tier-upgrade-page`

Better UX for the gate from branch 2. A Starter user hitting a forbidden route now lands on a personalized upgrade page instead of being silently redirected to `/dashboard/planner`.

### Files added

- `app/dashboard/upgrade/page.tsx` — client component with a `Suspense` wrapper for `useSearchParams`. Reads `?from=<moduleSlug>`, validates against `isModuleSlug`, and:
  - Personalizes the headline ("Unlock Travel" vs. generic "Upgrade your plan" for direct hits).
  - Renders a chip row of the Starter user's current picks (if they have any).
  - Shows three CTA cards: **Swap a module** (→ `/pricing?action=swap`, branch 4 handles), **Pro Monthly** ($10.60/mo via existing `/api/stripe/checkout`), **Lifetime** ($103.29 via same endpoint).
  - Footer reassurance: "A locked module's data is hidden, not deleted — re-select it anytime and everything is back."

### Files modified

- `lib/access/starter-modules.ts` — new `pathToModuleSlug(pathname)` reverse-lookup helper. Scans `STARTER_MODULES` for a prefix match and returns the slug, or `null` if the path doesn't belong to any pickable module. Used by the layout redirect to build the `?from=` query.
- `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`:
  - Adds `/dashboard/upgrade` to `FREE_ROUTE_PREFIXES` (must be reachable by every authenticated tier; otherwise a Starter user would loop trying to reach the upgrade page).
  - Redirect effect now forks by tier: **Starter** → `/dashboard/upgrade?from=<slug>` (or `/dashboard/upgrade` when the slug can't be resolved). **Invited** → `/dashboard/planner` (their flow isn't part of the Starter funnel; their allowed_modules are free-text prefixes, not module slugs — reusing the upgrade page would show wrong copy).

### Behavior delivered

- Starter user picks Finance + Workouts + Metrics, clicks a `/dashboard/travel/trips/new` link → redirected to `/dashboard/upgrade?from=travel`. Page reads "Unlock Travel. Trips, vehicles, fuel logs, maintenance, routes. It's not one of your picked Starter modules — choose a path below." Current picks shown as chips. Three CTAs.
- Direct navigation to `/dashboard/upgrade` (no query param) shows generic "Upgrade your plan" copy. Still useful.
- Pro and Lifetime buttons fire the same `/api/stripe/checkout` endpoint the pricing page uses — no new infrastructure.
- Swap button routes to `/pricing?action=swap` (branch 4 will read this query param and scroll to the module picker).

### Merge order

1. Branches 1 + 2 must be merged first.
2. Migration 182 applied in prod.
3. Merge `feat/starter-tier-upgrade-page`.
4. No new migrations, no new env vars.

### Verification

1. Set your user to Starter with three picks (see §18 verification SQL).
2. Type `/dashboard/travel` → should land on `/dashboard/upgrade?from=travel` with personalized copy.
3. Type `/dashboard/upgrade` directly → generic copy, same three CTAs.
4. Click "Pro — all modules" → Stripe checkout opens for Monthly plan.
5. Click "Swap a module" → navigates to `/pricing?action=swap` (picker arrives in branch 4).
6. Revert to `'monthly'` → `/dashboard/upgrade` is still reachable directly (no redirect loop since `allowedModules === null` for Monthly tier).

### Next branch

Branch 4 — see §20 below.

---

## 20. Starter tier branch 4 shipped — `feat/starter-tier-module-picker`

The picker that was referenced by branches 2 + 3 as "TBD". New Starter-tier visual + flow on the pricing page, and the live swap path for existing subscribers. New-subscription checkout is wired to the expected API contract; branch 5 adds the backend half.

### Files added

- `components/pricing/StarterModulePicker.tsx` — presentational picker. Props: `mode` (`'new' | 'swap'`), `initialSelection`, `initialCadence`, `onSubmit`, `onCancel`, `externalError`. Internal state for picked set (max 3 enforced with friendly error when user hits cap), billing cadence, submitting flag. Renders 8 checkbox cards in a 2-col grid with per-module icons from the Lucide map, a live `X / 3` counter, a monthly/annual cadence toggle (hidden in swap mode — cadence changes go through Stripe's customer portal), and a fuchsia Continue button that resolves its label from cadence and mode.
- `app/api/user/starter-modules/route.ts` — `PATCH` endpoint. Enforces: auth, `isValidStarterSelection` (exactly 3 unique valid slugs), `subscription_status='starter'` (only Starter tier can set this column — Lifetime/Monthly aren't module-gated). Uses the service-role client after the explicit auth check.

### Files modified

- `app/pricing/page.tsx`:
  - New state `pickerMode: 'new' | 'swap' | null` + `pickerError`.
  - Reads subscription via `useSubscription()` to know current tier + current picks.
  - `SwapActionTrigger` child (Suspense-wrapped) reads `?action=swap` query from `/dashboard/upgrade`'s swap button and auto-opens the modal in swap mode; immediately strips the query via `router.replace` so refresh doesn't reopen.
  - New `handleStarterSubmit(slugs, cadence)` forks by mode: swap → PATCH; new → POST `/api/stripe/checkout` with `plan: 'starter-monthly' | 'starter-annual'` and `selected_modules` metadata. Auth failures open the `PurchaseModal` as with existing plans.
  - Grid layout: `md:grid-cols-2 max-w-3xl` → `md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 max-w-6xl`. Starter card is leftmost; Monthly (Popular) middle; Lifetime (Best Value) right.
  - Starter card: "Start Small" badge, $5.46/mo price + "or $51.80/year (save 21%)" secondary line, five feature bullets focused on flexibility. CTA text forks by subscription: existing Starter subscribers see "Change your 3 modules" (opens swap mode); everyone else sees "Pick my 3 modules" (opens new mode).
  - Modal mount at the end wraps `<StarterModulePicker>` with the shared `Modal` component (size lg).

### Behavior delivered

- **New signup path:** visitor clicks "Pick my 3 modules" → modal opens → visitor toggles cadence + picks 3 → Continue → `/api/stripe/checkout` fires with the Starter plan slug. Branch 5 must implement the backend handler for this request; until then, the response will 400 and the picker surfaces "Starter checkout is coming soon" via `externalError`. The picker UI is fully usable for validation.
- **Swap path (fully live):** existing Starter user on `/dashboard/upgrade` clicks "Swap a module" → lands on `/pricing?action=swap` → picker auto-opens in swap mode pre-populated with their current 3 picks → they change one → Continue → PATCH `/api/user/starter-modules` → subscription hook refreshes → modal closes → nav visibility updates within the same render cycle because layout reads from `useSubscription()`.
- **Edge cases handled:** trying to check a 4th module surfaces the "uncheck one to swap" message; canceling the modal resets state; submitting with <3 picks shows validation error; not-logged-in visitors hit the existing `PurchaseModal` auth flow on Continue.

### Swap-path accessibility notes

- Cadence toggle uses `<fieldset>` + `<legend className="sr-only">` + radio inputs hidden via `sr-only` with styled labels. Screen readers announce the group and current selection. Keyboard nav works via Tab + arrow keys (browser default for radios in a fieldset).
- Live counter has `aria-live="polite"` so screen readers announce the updated count on each pick.
- Each module card's label wraps the input with `aria-describedby` pointing at the description span — screen readers read label + description together.

### Merge order

1. Branches 1 + 2 + 3 must be merged first.
2. Migration 182 applied in prod.
3. Merge `feat/starter-tier-module-picker`.
4. No new env vars yet (those come with branch 5).

### Verification

1. Fresh Incognito session → visit `/pricing` → Starter card renders with "Start Small" badge, "Pick my 3 modules" CTA.
2. Click CTA → modal opens, 8 module cards in 2×4 grid, cadence toggle shows Monthly/Annual.
3. Pick 3 → Continue label becomes "Continue — $5.46/mo" → click → expect 400 until branch 5, friendly error visible in picker.
4. Toggle cadence to Annual → label changes to "Continue — $51.80/yr".
5. Log in as existing Starter user (seeded per §18 verification SQL) → pricing Starter card reads "Change your 3 modules".
6. Click → modal opens in swap mode, current 3 picks pre-checked, no cadence toggle.
7. Uncheck one + check another → Continue → PATCH fires → modal closes → reload page → picker reopened in swap mode shows the new selection.
8. Hit `/pricing?action=swap` directly (matches the `/dashboard/upgrade` swap button) → picker auto-opens in swap mode → URL updates to `/pricing` (no refresh loop).

### Next branch

Branch 5 — see §21 below.

---

## 21. Starter tier branch 5 shipped — `feat/starter-tier-stripe`

Wires the backend half of what branch 4's picker was already calling. End-to-end Starter signup now works: visitor picks 3 modules → Stripe checkout → webhook writes `subscription_status='starter'` + `selected_modules` → dashboard layout immediately gates correctly. Also handles the downgrade path (subscription cancellation clears `selected_modules` to keep the schema invariant).

### Env vars required (already set by owner in Vercel + `.env.local`)

- `STRIPE_STARTER_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID` — $5.46/mo recurring price
- `STRIPE_STARTER_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID` — $51.80/yr recurring price

### Files modified

- `app/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts`:
  - `VALID_PLANS` gains `'starter-monthly'`, `'starter-annual'`.
  - Body destructures `selected_modules` alongside `plan`. For Starter plans, validates with `isValidStarterSelection` before doing any Stripe work.
  - Two new guard clauses: block Starter checkout when user is already `'monthly'` ("cancel Monthly first") or `'starter'` ("use the picker to swap"). Lifetime block unchanged.
  - New Starter branch creates the checkout session with the resolved price ID, serializes the 3 slugs as a comma-joined string in metadata (Stripe metadata values are strings ≤500 chars; 3 slugs fit trivially), and stamps the same metadata on the subscription via `subscription_data.metadata` so downstream subscription events can route without re-fetching the session.
- `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`:
  - New `parseSelectedModules(csv)` helper deserializes the CSV metadata and re-validates with `isValidStarterSelection` — defensive against truncation or manipulation.
  - New Starter branch in the `checkout.session.completed` switch: retrieves the subscription to get `current_period_end`, writes `subscription_status='starter'` + `selected_modules` + subscription id + expiry to `profiles`.
  - `customer.subscription.deleted` handler now clears `selected_modules` alongside the downgrade to `'free'`. Maintains the invariant "`selected_modules IS NULL` iff `subscription_status <> 'starter'`". Also implicitly arms plan 25c's revocation purger for any offline content tied to courses the downgraded user was enrolled in.
- `app/api/stripe/sync/route.ts`:
  - New Starter branch mirrors the webhook behavior for the billing-page-redirect fallback. Same CSV parse, same validation, same DB write. Returns `{ status: 'starter' }` on success.

### Behavior delivered — end-to-end Starter signup

1. Visitor lands on `/pricing`, clicks "Pick my 3 modules" → modal opens.
2. Picks 3 modules + cadence, clicks "Continue — $5.46/mo" (or annual).
3. Frontend POSTs `/api/stripe/checkout` with `{ plan: 'starter-monthly', selected_modules: ['finance','workouts','metrics'] }`.
4. Checkout route validates, creates customer if missing, creates session with the Starter price, stamps metadata on session + subscription, returns the URL.
5. Browser redirects to Stripe's hosted checkout.
6. Visitor completes payment.
7. Stripe fires `checkout.session.completed` → webhook parses `selected_modules` metadata, writes profile row.
8. Browser lands on `/dashboard/billing?success=true&session_id=cs_xxx`.
9. Billing page calls `/api/stripe/sync` as a safety net in case the webhook is delayed — idempotent; writes the same row if not already written.
10. User refreshes any dashboard page — `useSubscription()` reads `subscription_status='starter'` + `selected_modules`, dashboard layout gates accordingly, nav shows only picked + always-included items.

### Behavior delivered — downgrade

- User cancels via Stripe customer portal or billing page.
- Stripe fires `customer.subscription.deleted`.
- Webhook downgrades to `'free'` and clears `selected_modules`.
- User's next dashboard load: `hasAccess=false` (because `subStatus='free'`, not admin, not invited) → redirect to `/pricing`.
- Plan 25c's `RevokedAssetsPurger` runs on the next `/academy/*` visit → deletes any offline-cached lessons tied to courses the user was enrolled in via Starter.

### Merge order

1. Branches 1–4 merged.
2. Migration 182 applied.
3. **Owner: create two Stripe products / prices** (done per user confirmation 2026-04-16):
   - Starter Monthly — $5.46 USD recurring monthly
   - Starter Annual — $51.80 USD recurring yearly
4. **Owner: set env vars** `STRIPE_STARTER_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID` and `STRIPE_STARTER_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID` with the `price_xxx` values (done per user confirmation 2026-04-16).
5. Merge `feat/starter-tier-stripe`.

### Verification

1. `/pricing` → Starter card → "Pick my 3 modules" → pick 3 → Continue Monthly → real Stripe checkout loads (use Stripe test mode + card `4242 4242 4242 4242`).
2. Complete checkout → redirect to `/dashboard/billing?success=true&session_id=...`.
3. Inspect `profiles` row: `subscription_status='starter'`, `selected_modules` array matches picks, `stripe_subscription_id` populated, `subscription_expires_at` ~1 month out (or ~1 year for annual).
4. Navigate dashboard: only picked + always-included items in nav. `/dashboard/travel` (if not picked) → `/dashboard/upgrade?from=travel`.
5. From Stripe dashboard or billing page: cancel subscription → within seconds webhook fires → `profiles` row reverts to `'free'` with `selected_modules=null` → user is bounced to `/pricing`.
6. Try Starter checkout while already `'monthly'` → 400 with "Cancel your Monthly plan first".
7. Try Starter checkout while already `'starter'` → 400 with "use the module picker to swap".

### Next branch

Branch 6 — see §22 below.

---

## 22. Starter tier branch 6 shipped — `feat/starter-tier-admin-stats`

Final branch in the Starter-tier series. Adds visibility so the owner can watch Starter adoption and tune the module list based on actual picks.

### Files modified

- `app/api/admin/stats/route.ts`:
  - Imports `STARTER_MODULE_SLUGS` + `STARTER_MODULES` from the access-control lib so the API is the one source of truth for module labels.
  - Adds `starter` count alongside `free`/`monthly`/`lifetime` in the existing tier tally.
  - New per-user fetch of `selected_modules` scoped to `subscription_status='starter'` — small dataset, one round trip.
  - Computes `modulePopularity` (count + percentage per slug, sorted desc) and `topCombos` (top 5 3-module combinations, canonicalized by sorted-slug join so order-independent combinations are counted as the same combo).
  - `revenue.monthlyMRR` now includes `starter * 5.46` as a floor (annual subscribers contribute more because the $51.80 pre-pay offsets ~12 months of MRR accrual — we underreport monthly burn rate rather than overreport).
  - New `starter` response block: `{ total, modulePopularity, topCombos, estimatedMrrFloor }`. Rounded to 2 decimals.
- `app/admin/page.tsx`:
  - `Stats` interface extended with `starter` block and `users.starter`.
  - Top users grid widens from 4 to 5 columns on desktop to fit the new Starter card (Sparkles icon, sky color to match the pricing page Starter card).
  - New "Starter tier breakdown" section renders conditionally — only when `stats.starter.total > 0` so the overview stays clean before any Starter adoption.
  - Two cards inside the breakdown section:
    - **Module popularity:** progress-bar list with label + count + percentage, accessible via `role="progressbar"` + `aria-valuenow`.
    - **Top module combos:** ranked ordered list (1–5) showing the combo and the subscriber count.

### Behavior delivered

- Before Starter has any subscribers: admin overview shows the new Starter card with `0` and no breakdown section.
- After the first Starter signup: breakdown section appears, module popularity shows 100% for the three picked modules and 0% for the rest, combo #1 is that single user's picks.
- As adoption grows: owner can see at a glance which modules are being picked ("Finance is in 80% of Starter carts — we're not going to kill it") and which 3-module combinations cluster ("Finance + Workouts + Metrics is the dominant combo — maybe we should offer a 'Health + Money' preset").

### Merge order

1. Branches 1–5 merged.
2. Migration 182 applied.
3. Merge `feat/starter-tier-admin-stats`. No new env vars, no new migrations.

### Verification

1. As admin, visit `/admin` → `Starter ($5.46)` card shows current count.
2. With ≥1 active Starter subscriber (from branch 5 verification steps), Starter tier breakdown section appears.
3. Module popularity list is sorted with most-picked at top; percentages sum to ~300% when everyone picks exactly 3.
4. Top combos list groups users by canonical sorted-slug key — pick `['finance','workouts','metrics']` and a second user picks `['workouts','metrics','finance']` and they should count as the same combo.

### Starter tier series — done

Branches 1–6 ship a complete Pick-3-modules paid tier. Remaining work for the Starter tier is all operational (Stripe dashboard monitoring, customer support for swap questions) rather than engineering.

### Remaining backlog

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| 25 iOS validation pass | open — needs device |
| 26.0 smaller v1 | shipped |
| 26 full | blocked on survey + devrel reply |
| 30 Stripe fee calculator | ready — ~1–2 hrs |
| 31 i18n EN+ES + SEO | phased, 1–2 weeks |
| 32 admin email verification dashboard | shipped (this series, §23) |
| Starter tier | **fully shipped** (branches 1–6) |

---

## 23. Admin email verification — `feat/admin-email-verification`

Plan 32 shipped in one branch. Admin can see who hasn't verified and nudge them.

### Files added

- `plans/32-admin-email-verification.md` — plan doc with scope, API shapes, and verification checklist.
- `app/api/admin/users/[id]/resend-verification/route.ts` — POST endpoint. Admin-gated. Fetches the auth user by id, short-circuits when already verified, otherwise calls `auth.admin.generateLink({ type: 'magiclink', email })`. Magic link (not signup) because the target user already exists; clicking it both logs them in and confirms their email as a side effect.
- `app/api/admin/users/resend-all-unverified/route.ts` — POST endpoint. Admin-gated. Lists all auth users, filters to `!email_confirmed_at`, caps at 100 per call (returns 413 with a clear error above that), runs `generateLink` sequentially to respect Supabase's per-email rate limits. Returns `{ attempted, succeeded, failed, alreadyVerified, skippedMissingEmail }`.

### Files modified

- `app/api/admin/users/route.ts` — response rows now include `email_confirmed_at: string | null` drawn from `db.auth.admin.listUsers()`.
- `app/admin/users/page.tsx`:
  - `UserRow` gains `email_confirmed_at` + the `starter` status value.
  - New `Verified` column between `Email / Username` and `Plan`. Green checkmark with tooltip for verified users; amber `Resend` button (with `Mail` icon, `MailX` when no email on file, spinning loader while sending) for unverified.
  - New filter pill `✉ Unverified`. Also accepts `?filter=unverified` via URL.
  - New `starter` filter pill (was missing — needed for the pricing page to round-trip search URLs).
  - Header gains a `Resend to all unverified` button (only when ≥1 unverified user exists) with a confirmation modal before firing.
  - `STATUS_BADGE` map gains `starter: 'bg-sky-900/50 text-sky-300'`.
  - Summary line under the page title calls out the unverified count in amber.
  - Reload after per-row send (in case the user was already verified — toast explains).

### Behavior delivered

- Admin visits `/admin/users` — every row has a Verified cell. Header shows "X unverified" if any. Top-right shows a bulk resend button when there are unverified users.
- Filter by `✉ Unverified` — table collapses to the unverified subset.
- Click per-row `Resend` — toast "Verification email sent to foo@bar.com" (or "already verified — no email sent" if the status is stale). No refresh needed; users page reloads automatically to sync.
- Click `Resend to all unverified` — confirmation modal shows the count. Confirm → toast with the success/failure/skip breakdown.
- Over 100 unverified: the bulk endpoint returns 413 with a helpful message; admin should filter and resend per-row, or call again (each call processes the first 100 it sees).

### Merge order

1. Merge `feat/admin-email-verification`. No migrations, no new env vars.
2. Standalone feature — doesn't depend on the Starter-tier series and can land before or after those.

### Verification

1. DB inspect: an unverified user has `auth.users.email_confirmed_at = NULL`.
2. Admin `/admin/users` → their row shows the amber `Resend` button.
3. Click → toast success → check inbox (or Supabase dashboard → Auth → Logs) for the magic link.
4. Filter by `✉ Unverified` → only unverified users remain.
5. Click `Resend to all unverified` → modal → confirm → expect one email per unverified user.
6. As the user, click the magic link → log in + `email_confirmed_at` populated → admin sees green checkmark after reload.

## 24. Bug backlog (owner-reported 2026-04-16)

Not plans, just captured bugs. Each needs its own branch when worked on.

### 24.1 — "Recipe Ideas" button fixed (shipped in `feat/ai-recipe-generator`)

Owner decision 2026-04-16: option C — route to an AI recipe generator, with a secondary link to the public recipes hub.

**Surprise finding:** the full AI generator already existed at [app/dashboard/fuel/recipe-ideas/page.tsx](../../app/dashboard/fuel/recipe-ideas/page.tsx) with a live `/api/ai/recipe-ideas` Gemini-powered endpoint. The Fuel-page button had just been left pointing at `/tech-roadmap` with a `coming soon` flag. Zero new implementation needed — only wiring.

**Changes:**
- [app/dashboard/fuel/page.tsx](../../app/dashboard/fuel/page.tsx): Recipe Ideas card `href` → `/dashboard/fuel/recipe-ideas`, dropped the `comingSoon` flag and its UI branches (no other module used it).
- [app/dashboard/fuel/recipe-ideas/page.tsx](../../app/dashboard/fuel/recipe-ideas/page.tsx): header now has a secondary "Browse recipes" CTA linking to `/recipes` (the public hub) alongside the primary "Generate Ideas" button. Satisfies owner request for the public-hub link.

Bug closed.

### 24.2 — Finance scanner uses `/dashboard/scan` (shipped in `bug/finance-use-shared-scanner`)

Finance page was using the shared `ScanButton` component inline — captured receipt, pre-filled the Add Transaction modal with extracted fields (amount, vendor, date, line-item description). Simple but minimal.

`/dashboard/scan` has the richer flow: auto-routing (receipt → finance, recipe → recipes, maintenance → travel), ScanResultRouter for reviewing + editing extracted fields, line-item price history recording, receipt_line_items persistence, and contact attachment. Owner's assessment of "better UI/UX" tracks.

**Changes in [app/dashboard/finance/page.tsx](../../app/dashboard/finance/page.tsx):**
- Removed `ScanButton` + `ScanResult` + `ReceiptExtraction` imports.
- Removed `handleScanResult` handler (no longer needed — the scan page creates the transaction directly and links to the transaction detail page).
- Replaced the inline `<ScanButton>` with a `<Link href="/dashboard/scan">` styled identically (same purple button + ScanLine icon).

Transaction creation path now:
1. User on `/dashboard/finance` clicks "Scan Receipt" → routes to `/dashboard/scan`.
2. Capture/upload → Gemini OCR → `ScanResultRouter` preview.
3. Confirm → `/api/finance/transactions` POST + line item price records + receipt_line_items + source linking.
4. Success state links back to `/dashboard/finance/transactions/{id}` for review.

Bug closed.

### 24.3 — Landing-page checkmarks fixed (shipped in `bug/landing-checkmark-icons`)

Screenshot at [plans/bugs/Bugs-checkmarks-Screenshot 2026-04-16 at 18.02.41.png](../bugs/Bugs-checkmarks-Screenshot%202026-04-16%20at%2018.02.41.png) showed the literal string `&check;` rendering next to each feature bullet on the marketing pages. Root cause: JSX doesn't HTML-decode HTML entities the way raw HTML does — `&check;` inside a `<span>...</span>` JSX text node is emitted as the literal seven-character string.

**Fixed in [app/page.tsx:271](../../app/page.tsx#L271) and [app/features/page.tsx:80](../../app/features/page.tsx#L80):** replaced `&check;` with the Unicode checkmark `✓` (U+2713) and added `aria-hidden="true"` so screen readers don't announce it (the list-item text is the meaningful content).

Tech roadmap was also listed as broken but uses lucide's `CheckCircle2` component throughout — renders correctly with no fix needed. If the owner sees something different on `/tech-roadmap`, include a URL/screenshot and we'll reopen.

Bug closed.

## 25. Strategic pivot — `docs/bvc-direction-and-plan-33`

Owner-signed direction 2026-04-16 after reviewing `plans/ecosystem/`. Full detail at [`../ecosystem/centenarianos-direction.md`](../ecosystem/centenarianos-direction.md). Summary:

### 25.1 — Five directional decisions

1. **Stop adding Academy features; start producing BVC content.** Infrastructure audit (direction doc §3) puts Academy at ~90% complete for BVC Episode 1 needs. Ship Episode 1 against what exists; fix gaps only if encountered.
2. **Plan 26 full cancelled.** Native Insta360 companion would cross into Wanderlearn's scope. Plan 26.0 (already shipped) is the terminal work. Research brief stays as historical context.
3. **Starter tier stays CentOS-only for 90 days.** Re-evaluate propagation after subscription data comes in. Marketing must not claim "WitUS pricing" for the $5.46 tier until validated.
4. **Magic-link auth is a long-term priority.** Added as plan 34 (backlog stub). Every new auth change must move toward magic-link, not away.
5. **DB-sharing with Work.WitUS flagged as architectural debt.** Not deciding today — keep current shared-DB rules from CLAUDE.md, revisit when owner picks a direction.

### 25.2 — Files added

- [`../ecosystem/centenarianos-direction.md`](../ecosystem/centenarianos-direction.md) — captures the five decisions above + Academy infra completeness audit. Pointed at from STYLE_GUIDE §6a.
- [`../33-bvc-episode-1-coffee.md`](../33-bvc-episode-1-coffee.md) — content-production plan for the Academy's flagship episode. Strict editorial rules from the ecosystem doc. Lesson arc drafted for owner approval.
- [`../34-auth-magic-link-migration.md`](../34-auth-magic-link-migration.md) — backlog stub for the magic-link migration. Phased approach (A–D) so we can watch delivery reliability.

### 25.3 — Files modified

- [`../../STYLE_GUIDE.md`](../../STYLE_GUIDE.md): added **§6a — Ecosystem + direction docs are required reading before proposing features**. Claude must read the three ecosystem docs before scoping any new feature and surface conflicts before coding. Updated §7 gitignore exception list to include `plans/ecosystem/`.

### 25.4 — Remaining backlog (post-pivot)

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| **33** BVC Episode 1 (Coffee) | **ready — awaiting owner approval of lesson arc §4** |
| 25 iOS validation pass | open — needs device |
| 26.0 smaller v1 | shipped |
| **26 full** | **cancelled — see §25.1.2** |
| 30 Stripe fee calculator | ready — ~1–2 hrs |
| 31 i18n EN+ES + SEO | phased, 1–2 weeks |
| 32 admin email verification | shipped |
| **34** Magic-link auth migration | backlog stub |
| Starter tier | shipped, 90-day monitoring |
| BVC Episodes 2–7 | not planned — wait for Episode 1 validation |
| Academy → FlashLearnAI deep-link | not planned — post-Episode 1 |
| Academy → Wanderlearn preview blocks | not planned — post-Episode 1 |
| Fly.WitUS → CentOS activity import | not planned — post-Episode 1 |

### 25.5 — Next action for the human

Owner confirms the §4 lesson arc in [plan 33](../33-bvc-episode-1-coffee.md) (or revises), sets course pricing, starts drafting Lesson 1 content. Claude's role during plan 33 is primarily editorial assistance + Academy CSV-import wiring, not new code.

---

## 26. BVC Episode 1: Coffee — content load — `feat/bvc-coffee-content-load`

Strategic pivot from "add more Academy infrastructure" to "ship actual Academy content" per the ecosystem direction. Master doc at [plans/BVC/BVC_Episode_1_Coffee_MASTER.md](../BVC/BVC_Episode_1_Coffee_MASTER.md) converted to Academy-ready assets. **Audio recording deferred** — all lessons ship as text + data + maps first, upgrade to audio lesson type when MP3s drop.

### 26.1 — Decisions confirmed this branch

From owner review of `plans/BVC/`:

1. **Arc matches master doc**, not the chronological version I first drafted. Episode 1 has a subject-lens structure across all 7 Season 1 episodes: Cold Open → Geography → Social Studies → Economics → ELA → Closing → Quiz → Project.
2. **Audience: podcast listeners ages 25–45 primary; grades 9–12 IAS-aligned educational target secondary.** Marketing copy and Welcome lesson lead with adult podcast framing.
3. **Teacher resources:** attached as downloadable document on Lesson 1 (via `lessons.documents` JSONB) — not a separate role-gated module (that primitive doesn't exist yet; not built here).
4. **Duplicate file deleted:** `plans/BVC/BVC_Episode_1_Coffee_MASTER (1).md` removed (byte-identical to the canonical file).
5. **Season 2 + 3 content exists at `plans/BVC/BVC Season 2 and 3/`** — 7 more episodes (Beer, Wine, Whiskey, Rum, Tequila/Mezcal, Sake, Synthesis) + Season 3 forbidden-leaf plan (Tobacco, Cannabis, Opium, Coca, Psychedelics, Khat, Synthesis). Same 4-subject-lens structure. Out of scope for this branch — ship Episode 1 first, validate against real students, then scale.

### 26.2 — Files added

**Source-of-truth content (force-added under `content/`):**
- [`content/tutorials/bvc/coffee/01-welcome.md`](../../content/tutorials/bvc/coffee/01-welcome.md) through `08-project.md` — 8 student-facing lesson markdowns.
- [`content/tutorials/bvc/coffee/map.json`](../../content/tutorials/bvc/coffee/map.json) — Lesson 2 Geography `map_content`: 13 markers (top 10 producers + 3 historical trade ports), 3 trade-route polylines (Yemen→Ottoman, Ottoman→Europe, Colonial Atlantic), 2 Coffee Belt polygons (north + south halves).
- [`content/tutorials/bvc/coffee/quiz.json`](../../content/tutorials/bvc/coffee/quiz.json) — Lesson 7 `quiz_content`: 8 multiple-choice questions with explanations + APA citations, 75% passing score, unlimited attempts.
- [`content/tutorials/bvc/coffee/documents.json`](../../content/tutorials/bvc/coffee/documents.json) — Lesson 1 `documents` array: teacher resources (PDF placeholder) + 5 primary-source URLs with archive attribution.
- [`content/tutorials/bvc/coffee/teacher-resources.md`](../../content/tutorials/bvc/coffee/teacher-resources.md) — full teacher guide (IAS + Common Core alignment, 4 classroom activities, project rubrics, knowledge-check answers, differentiation, bibliography). Owner uploads this as PDF to Cloudinary and pastes the URL into `documents.json`.
- [`content/tutorials/bvc/coffee/glossary.csv`](../../content/tutorials/bvc/coffee/glossary.csv) — 21 glossary terms drawn from the master doc's Pronunciation Quick Reference + Geography/Social Studies/Economics/ELA vocabulary.

**Import-ready CSVs (tracked under `public/templates/`):**
- [`public/templates/bvc-episode-1-coffee-lessons.csv`](../../public/templates/bvc-episode-1-coffee-lessons.csv) — 8 lessons ready for owner import via `/dashboard/teaching/[username]/courses/[id]/import`. JSON cells (map_content, documents, quiz_content) minified and CSV-escaped; round-trip tested.
- [`public/templates/bvc-season-1-recording-schedule.csv`](../../public/templates/bvc-season-1-recording-schedule.csv) — 42 tasks across 7 episode goals in a single roadmap (`BVC Season 1 Recording`). Per-episode cadence: prep → record day 1 → record day 2 → edit → QA → publish. 2 weeks per episode, April 20 → August 14, 2026.

**Tooling:**
- [`scripts/generate-bvc-coffee-csv.mjs`](../../scripts/generate-bvc-coffee-csv.mjs) — regenerates the lessons CSV from the source markdown + JSON whenever content changes. Pattern for Episodes 2–7 when their time comes.

**Plan:**
- [`plans/33-bvc-episode-1-coffee.md`](../33-bvc-episode-1-coffee.md) — revised (content production pipeline, arc matching master doc, audio upgrade path, success criteria).

### 26.3 — Owner import steps

After merging this branch:

1. `/dashboard/teaching/[username]/courses/new` — create course:
   - Title: *Better Vice Club: Coffee*
   - Category: *Better Vice Club*
   - Navigation: `cyoa`
   - Price: decide (suggested $19.99 one-time or bundled in paid tier)
   - Cover image: origin-region or extraction photo (not a stock mug shot)
2. Import lessons: course editor → Import → upload `public/templates/bvc-episode-1-coffee-lessons.csv`, mode `create`.
3. Upload teacher-resources.md as a PDF (or markdown) to Cloudinary folder `academy/bvc/coffee/` and replace `REPLACE_WITH_CLOUDINARY_URL_AFTER_UPLOADING_teacher-resources.pdf` in the Lesson 1 documents array.
4. Import glossary via `/dashboard/teaching/[username]/courses/[id]/glossary` → upload `content/tutorials/bvc/coffee/glossary.csv`.
5. Publish: toggle `is_published = true`.
6. Import recording schedule: `/dashboard/data/import/planner` → upload `public/templates/bvc-season-1-recording-schedule.csv`.

### 26.4 — Audio upgrade path

When each segment's MP3 is recorded (per the schedule):

1. Upload MP3 to Cloudinary `academy/bvc/coffee/`.
2. Edit the lesson via the course editor:
   - Change `lesson_type` from `text` → `audio`.
   - Paste the Cloudinary secure URL into `content_url`.
   - Paste chapter markers (CUT-1A, CUT-1B, etc. with timestamps from the recording).
   - Paste synced transcript into `transcript_content`.
   - `text_content` (the data sheet) remains intact as reading material alongside the audio.

No code changes, no redeploy. The lesson page renders audio player + transcript + chapters + data sheet automatically based on `lesson_type`.

### 26.5 — Merge order

1. Owner reviews the lesson content, especially Lesson 2 Geography's map markers (lat/lon accuracy) and Lesson 7 quiz questions.
2. Merge `feat/bvc-coffee-content-load` to main.
3. Owner runs the import steps in §25.3.
4. Audio recording proceeds on the schedule in the second CSV.

### 26.6 — Remaining backlog

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| **33 BVC Episode 1 Coffee** | **content loaded this branch; awaiting owner import + audio recording** |
| 25 iOS validation pass | open — needs device |
| 26 full | cancelled (per direction doc, belongs to Wanderlearn) |
| 30 Stripe fee calculator | ready — ~1–2 hrs |
| 31 i18n EN+ES + SEO | phased |
| 32 admin email verification | shipped |
| 34 Magic-link auth migration | backlog stub |
| BVC Episodes 2–7 Season 1 | content exists at `plans/BVC/`, load after Episode 1 validates |
| BVC Season 2 (Episodes 8–14) — alcohol | content exists at `plans/BVC/BVC Season 2 and 3/`, load after Season 1 ships |
| BVC Season 3 (Episodes 15–21) — forbidden leaf | content exists, plan at `plans/BVC/BVC Season 2 and 3/BVC_Season_3_The_Forbidden_Leaf_MASTER_PLAN.md`, load after Season 2 ships |
| Starter tier | shipped, 90-day monitoring |

---

## 27. BVC launch polish + post-launch backlog — `feat/bvc-polish-and-post-launch-plans`

Closes the "final 10%" minor-gap list from [`ecosystem/centenarianos-direction.md §3.2`](../ecosystem/centenarianos-direction.md). One code change that was blocking Episode 1's marketing polish; four plan stubs for items that don't need to ship before launch but are the obvious next moves after Episode 1 validates.

### 27.1 — Code changes

- **[`components/academy/course-editor/CourseInfoTab.tsx`](../../components/academy/course-editor/CourseInfoTab.tsx) — `CATEGORY_OPTIONS`:** added `Better Vice Club` as the first option in the course-category datalist. Teachers creating BVC courses now get it as an autocomplete suggestion rather than having to type it freeform (risking typo drift across Episodes 1–7).

That's the only code change. Every other gap item is either backlog-plan material (§27.2) or already enforced in plan 33 (§27.3).

### 27.2 — Post-launch plan stubs added

Each is a backlog-ready design doc with scope, data model, files to add/modify, verification checklist, and risks. No code yet — open the branch when the plan reaches the top of the queue.

- [`plans/35-academy-completion-certificates.md`](../35-academy-completion-certificates.md) — `course_completions` table, HTML→PDF via Puppeteer or `@react-pdf/renderer`, Cloudinary storage, public verification URL, email delivery via existing Resend integration. Estimate 2–3 days.
- [`plans/36-academy-teacher-analytics.md`](../36-academy-teacher-analytics.md) — cohort heatmap (students × lessons) on the teacher course-detail page. Single aggregate endpoint + one grid component + CSV export. Estimate 1–2 days. Build when ≥5 real students per course.
- [`plans/37-a11y-axe-core-ci.md`](../37-a11y-axe-core-ci.md) — `@axe-core/playwright` smoke tests on top-10 routes, GitHub Actions on every PR against main. Phased: baseline scan → fix critical/serious → enable enforcement. Estimate 2–3 days. Ship before scaling BVC to schools that require WCAG AA.
- [`plans/38-classroom-family-plan.md`](../38-classroom-family-plan.md) — `family_plans` + `family_plan_members` tables, multi-seat Stripe tier, invitation flow, "covered by" billing messaging. **Explicitly blocked on demand validation** — don't build until at least one real teacher asks for bulk-enrollment. BVC Episode 1 tests the assumption that per-student enrollment is adequate.

### 27.3 — Content-production rules (already in place, not re-shipping)

Items from the gap list that are already enforced by the existing plan 33 §3 "Content rules (non-negotiable, per ecosystem doc)":

- **APA citations with working URLs** — plan 33 §3 rule 2. Enforced editorially.
- **Indigenous knowledge treated as valid and rigorous** — plan 33 §3 rule 4. Enforced editorially.
- **No-fabrication rule** — plan 33 §3 rule 1 (no Rosa, Mrs. Chen, Uncle Keoni, Elena, Dr. Martinez). Enforced editorially.
- **Peer-reviewed sources for scientific claims** — plan 33 §3 rule 3.
- **No sensationalism** — plan 33 §3 rule 5.

These are editorial gates, not code. Enforcement happens during content review before publish.

### 27.4 — Episode authoring workflow

Per the direction doc: **adequate for Episode 1**. Single-owner authoring via the course editor + bulk CSV import as the escape hatch. Plan 33's [CSV template](../../public/templates/bvc-episode-1-coffee-lessons.csv) + [generator script](../../scripts/generate-bvc-coffee-csv.mjs) make Episodes 2–7 a template exercise rather than from-scratch work.

No workflow changes needed. Revisit if multiple teachers need to co-author simultaneously.

### 27.5 — Merge order

1. This branch stacks on `feat/bvc-coffee-content-load` (§26). Merge 26 first, then 27.
2. Single tiny code change — safe to merge. Plan stubs are docs only.
3. No migrations, no new env vars.

### 27.6 — Remaining backlog (after §26 + §27 land)

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| **33 BVC Episode 1 Coffee** | content loaded (§26); owner to import + record audio per schedule |
| 25 iOS validation pass | open — needs device |
| 26 full | cancelled (belongs to Wanderlearn) |
| 30 Stripe fee calculator | ready — ~1–2 hrs |
| 31 i18n EN+ES + SEO | phased |
| 32 admin email verification | shipped |
| 34 Magic-link auth migration | backlog stub |
| **35 completion certificates** | **new** — backlog, 2–3 days |
| **36 teacher analytics heatmap** | **new** — backlog, 1–2 days, build at ≥5 students/course |
| **37 a11y axe-core CI** | **new** — backlog, 2–3 days, ship before school-scale |
| **38 classroom/family plan** | **new** — blocked on teacher demand signal |
| BVC Episodes 2–7 Season 1 | content exists; load after Episode 1 validates |
| BVC Season 2 + 3 | content exists; load after Season 1 ships |
| Starter tier | shipped, 90-day monitoring |

---

## 28. Plan 30 shipped — Stripe fee calculator — `feat/stripe-fee-calculator`

Owner-requested quick win from earlier session ("add a live fee calculator to the course form everywhere a user sets the price of a product"). Plan 30 scoped it to a pure-component breakdown wired first into the teacher course-editor. Shipped as designed.

### 28.1 — Files added

- [`components/ui/StripeFeeBreakdown.tsx`](../../components/ui/StripeFeeBreakdown.tsx) — pure functional component. Props: `{ amount, cycle?, theme?, compact? }`. Returns `null` for zero/non-positive/non-numeric amounts so the host UI stays clean pre-input. Renders:
  - `Customer pays: $X.XX[/cycle]`
  - `Stripe fee (2.9% + $0.30): −$X.XX`
  - `You receive: $X.XX[/cycle]`
  - Loss banner with AlertTriangle when fee exceeds price (e.g., a $0.30 listing → $-0.01 net).
  - `aria-live="polite"` on the container so screen readers announce recalculations. Labeled as a description list (`<dl>`/`<dt>`/`<dd>`).
  - `theme` prop (`'light' | 'dark'`) adapts colors for the teacher editor's dark theme vs. light-theme surfaces elsewhere.
  - `cycle` prop suffixes `/month` or `/year` on subscription courses so teachers see fee compounds per billing cycle.

### 28.2 — Files modified

- [`components/academy/course-editor/PricingAccessTab.tsx`](../../components/academy/course-editor/PricingAccessTab.tsx):
  - Added local `priceDraft` state (as string) so the breakdown updates live as the teacher types — the existing `onBlur → saveCourseField({ price: Number })` save path is unchanged.
  - Price input switched from uncontrolled (`defaultValue`) to controlled (`value` + `onChange`) for live preview. Save semantics identical.
  - `step="0.01"` + `min="0"` on the input for cent-level precision and no-negative.
  - `htmlFor`/`id` pair added so the label properly associates with the input (accessibility).
  - `<StripeFeeBreakdown amount={draftAmount} cycle={cycle} theme="dark" />` renders directly below the price input when `price_type !== 'free'`. `cycle` derived from `course.price_type`: `'subscription'` → `'monthly'`, `'one_time'` → `'one_time'`.

### 28.3 — Behavior

- Teacher opens course editor → Pricing & Access tab → selects One-time price type → types `19.99` → sees "Customer pays $19.99 · Stripe fee −$0.88 · You receive $19.11" instantly.
- Switches to Subscription type → the same $19.99 shows "/month" suffixes; the Stripe fee applies every billing cycle (teacher sees the recurring math on-screen).
- Types `0.30` (edge case) → breakdown turns red with "Fee exceeds price — you'd lose money on each sale." The save still happens on blur because this is a soft warning, not a hard gate.
- Clears the field or types `0` → breakdown disappears entirely (returns null).

### 28.4 — Out of scope (per plan 30)

- Non-US card rates (3.9% + $0.30 international) — documented as "floor" not "actual."
- Stripe Connect platform fee (teacher payouts already factor a 15% platform cut elsewhere). A future `TeacherPayoutBreakdown` component could compose this one plus the platform fee.
- Invoice line-item pricing — future integration point when that surface ships.
- Annual-cycle lifetime projections — deliberately skipped to keep the component single-purpose.

### 28.5 — Merge order

1. Branch is off `main` post-BVC merges. No dependencies.
2. No migrations, no env vars, no API changes.
3. Merge `feat/stripe-fee-calculator` to `main`.

### 28.6 — Verification

1. `/dashboard/teaching/[username]/courses/[id]` → Pricing & Access tab.
2. Set price type to One-time, type `19.99` → breakdown shows $19.99 / −$0.88 / $19.11.
3. Switch to Subscription → breakdown shows `/month` on customer + receive lines.
4. Type `0.30` → red loss warning appears, AlertTriangle rendered.
5. Clear the field → breakdown hides.
6. Switch price type to Free → input + breakdown both hide.
7. VoiceOver pass: announces "Stripe fee breakdown: Customer pays nineteen dollars ninety-nine cents…" on change.

### 28.7 — Remaining backlog (unchanged except 30 → shipped)

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| **33 BVC Episode 1 Coffee** | content loaded (§26); owner to import + record audio |
| 25 iOS validation pass | open — needs device |
| 26 full | cancelled |
| **30 Stripe fee calculator** | **shipped (this branch)** |
| 31 i18n EN+ES + SEO | phased |
| 32 admin email verification | shipped |
| 34 Magic-link auth migration | backlog stub |
| 35 completion certificates | backlog, 2–3 days |
| 36 teacher analytics heatmap | backlog, 1–2 days |
| 37 a11y axe-core CI | backlog, 2–3 days |
| 38 classroom/family plan | blocked on demand |
| BVC Episodes 2–7 / Season 2+3 | content exists; phased load |
| Starter tier | shipped, 90-day monitoring |

## 29. Plan 37 Phase A shipped — a11y axe-core CI — `feat/a11y-axe-core-ci`

Ships the scaffolding for the accessibility smoke suite described in plan 37: 10 public routes, axe-core rules for WCAG 2.1 A + AA, GitHub Actions on every PR + push to main. **Baseline mode** (non-blocking) at launch so the owner can run the initial scan and triage violations without PRs failing in the interim. Flip to enforcing mode once critical/serious count is zero on main.

### 29.1 — Files added

- [`tests/a11y/routes.spec.ts`](../../tests/a11y/routes.spec.ts) — Playwright spec. 10 tests, one per route: `/`, `/pricing`, `/signup`, `/login`, `/academy`, `/recipes`, `/blog`, `/coaching`, `/features`, `/tech-roadmap`. Each loads the route with `waitUntil: 'networkidle'`, runs `AxeBuilder({ page }).withTags(['wcag2a','wcag2aa','wcag21a','wcag21aa']).analyze()`, and asserts zero critical + zero serious violations unless `SKIP_ENFORCEMENT=1` is set (baseline mode). Every violation logs the `id`, `help`, `helpUrl`, and first 3 selectors for quick triage.
- [`playwright.a11y.config.ts`](../../playwright.a11y.config.ts) — scoped Playwright config. Chromium desktop only, 60s timeout, `retain-on-failure` traces + screenshots, HTML report at `playwright-report/a11y/`. Excluded from main tsconfig because `@playwright/test` isn't installed yet.
- [`.github/workflows/a11y.yml`](../../.github/workflows/a11y.yml) — GitHub Actions. Runs on every PR to main, every push to main, and on-demand via `workflow_dispatch` with an `enforce` input. Installs deps via `npm ci`, installs Chromium with `--with-deps`, runs `npm run build` + `npm run start`, waits on `http://localhost:3000` via `wait-on`, then runs the suite. Uploads the HTML report as an artifact (7-day retention). **Currently marked `continue-on-error: true`** — does not block PRs yet. Flip to `false` after the baseline scan is clean on main.
- [`tests/a11y/README.md`](../../tests/a11y/README.md) — local-run instructions, scope documentation, how to add routes, how to graduate from baseline to enforcing.

### 29.2 — Files modified

- [`package.json`](../../package.json):
  - New devDeps: `@axe-core/playwright` (`^4.10.0`), `@playwright/test` (`^1.48.0`).
  - New scripts:
    - `test:a11y` — enforcing run.
    - `test:a11y:baseline` — logs violations without failing, for the first-run triage.
- [`tsconfig.json`](../../tsconfig.json) — added `tests` and `playwright.a11y.config.ts` to `exclude` so the main tsc run doesn't require `@playwright/test` to resolve. Test suite has its own toolchain (Playwright's own tsc-equivalent + Node runtime); no shared inclusion needed.

### 29.3 — Behavior

**Before install:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck` passes as before — tests/ and the playwright config are excluded.
- `npm run test:a11y` errors "missing module @playwright/test" until `npm install` runs. Expected.

**After first install (owner runs from home):**
- Owner runs `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium` one-time.
- `npm run dev` (terminal 1) + `npm run test:a11y:baseline` (terminal 2) produces the first violation list. Console output groups by route with impact + rule id + selector + help URL.
- Owner triages: every critical + serious item gets a branch + fix. Each fix lands via the normal branch-per-change flow (STYLE_GUIDE §1), and the report gets a new section per STYLE_GUIDE §5a.

**Once critical + serious count is zero on main:**
- Flip the `continue-on-error: true` line in `.github/workflows/a11y.yml` to `false` (or delete the line). PRs now block on a11y regressions.
- Triage moderate + minor violations at a slower cadence.

### 29.4 — What's NOT covered (Phase B)

Per plan 37:
- Authenticated surfaces (`/dashboard`, `/dashboard/teaching/*`, lesson pages). Need a scripted-login Playwright fixture.
- Mobile viewport matrix (iPhone SE, iPad).
- Interactive states: modal open, dropdown expanded, dark-mode toggle on, reduced-motion.
- Keyboard-only navigation recording.
- Lighthouse / PWA / perf scoring.
- Storybook component-level a11y.

All of those are worth building in a follow-up when the Phase A baseline is stable.

### 29.5 — Merge order

1. Branch is off `main` post-Stripe-fee-calculator merge. No plan dependencies.
2. Merge `feat/a11y-axe-core-ci` to `main`.
3. CI workflow runs on the merge commit in baseline mode — produces the first violation report as an artifact.
4. Owner downloads the artifact, triages, and opens remediation branches.

### 29.6 — Verification (once install runs)

1. `npm install` — verifies deps resolve.
2. `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium` — verifies browser binary installs.
3. `npm run dev` — server up.
4. `npm run test:a11y:baseline` — suite runs, lists violations per route, does not fail.
5. `npm run test:a11y` — suite runs, fails with specific violation messages if any critical/serious.
6. Deliberate regression (e.g., add `<button aria-label="">` without a label) → enforcing run fails with a specific rule id pointing at the selector.
7. GitHub Actions run: PR opens → `Accessibility` workflow runs → artifact uploaded.

### 29.7 — Expected baseline violations

Predicted hot spots (spot-check intuition, not a real scan):

- Teacher editor is the most-touched UI with the most recent contrast sweeps — likely some residual dark-on-dark placeholders.
- PSV video player has color-only state indicators.
- Radio groups in quiz UI may be missing `<fieldset>`/`<legend>`.
- Pricing page's Starter card uses sky-300 on white — check contrast ratio.
- Landing page's colored section headers may need darker variants.

Budget ~1 day for remediation after the baseline scan, same day as the install.

## 30. Plan 35 shipped — Academy completion certificates — `feat/academy-completion-certificates`

End-to-end completion certificates. When a student finishes every lesson in a course, the system records the completion, sends a congratulations email with a verification link, shows a certificate callout on the last-lesson page, and surfaces a "Certificate" button on `/academy/my-courses`. Anyone with the verification URL can view the HTML certificate and download a branded PDF.

Scope matched plan 35 §1–§6. Client-side PDF via existing `jspdf` dependency (already in the bundle — no npm install needed). No Cloudinary storage of PDFs: the HTML verification page is the canonical artifact; PDFs regenerate on demand.

### 30.1 — Files added

- [`supabase/migrations/183_course_completions.sql`](../../supabase/migrations/183_course_completions.sql) — one row per `(user_id, course_id)` with a 32-hex-char `verification_token`. RLS: users read own; teachers read their own courses' completions; service role (used by the public verify page) bypasses.
- [`app/api/academy/courses/[id]/complete/route.ts`](../../app/api/academy/courses/%5Bid%5D/complete/route.ts) — POST. Idempotent: counts completed lessons vs. total; if all done, upserts completion row (race-safe via `UNIQUE(user_id, course_id)`), fires Resend email, returns `{ completed, token, completionAlreadyExisted }`. If not all done, returns `{ completed: false, remainingLessons, totalLessons }`. Safe to call on every lesson completion — endpoint decides.
- [`app/academy/verify/[token]/page.tsx`](../../app/academy/verify/%5Btoken%5D/page.tsx) — **public** server-rendered verification. Service-role reads the completion by token (no RLS dependency — the token is the access check). Renders the branded card, the download button, and a "this page's existence is the verification" footer note. `robots: { index: false, follow: false }` to keep certs out of search engines.
- [`components/academy/CertificateDownloadButton.tsx`](../../components/academy/CertificateDownloadButton.tsx) — client component. Dynamically imports `jspdf` on click so the ~200KB library doesn't land on the initial page bundle. Landscape letter, fuchsia border, centered student name (wraps if long), course title, completed date + teacher in a footer row, and the verification URL printed on the cert so third parties can re-verify from a printed copy. Filename: `{Student_Name}-{Course_Title}-certificate.pdf`.

### 30.2 — Files modified

- [`app/academy/[courseId]/lessons/[lessonId]/page.tsx`](../../app/academy/%5BcourseId%5D/lessons/%5BlessonId%5D/page.tsx):
  - New `courseCompletion` state.
  - `markComplete()` now calls `POST /api/academy/courses/[id]/complete` fire-and-forget after the lesson's own progress is saved.
  - When the response says the course is complete, a gradient callout ("Course complete — certificate earned 🎓") renders above the CYOA/linear navigation with a "View certificate →" button pointing at `/academy/verify/{token}`. Distinguishes first-issue vs. revisit via `completionAlreadyExisted`.
  - Tailwind v4 canonicals: `bg-linear-to-br` (not `bg-gradient-to-br`). Caught by linter; fixed.
- [`app/api/academy/my-courses/route.ts`](../../app/api/academy/my-courses/route.ts) — one extra query fetching `course_completions` for the user filtered by their enrolled courses. Each result row gains `certificate_token: string | null`.
- [`app/academy/my-courses/page.tsx`](../../app/academy/my-courses/page.tsx) — `EnrolledCourse` interface gains `certificate_token`. When non-null, a fuchsia "Certificate" button (Award icon) renders alongside "Start/Continue/Review" and "Take Again". Student can jump to the verification page from their course list.

### 30.3 — Behavior

- Student completes final lesson → `markComplete` fires → lesson's own `completed_at` saves → `/complete` endpoint validates course-is-done → inserts row + token → sends email → client callout shows "certificate earned 🎓" with View button.
- Student visits `/academy/my-courses` → any course with a token shows "Certificate" button.
- Anyone with the verification URL sees the student name, course title, teacher name, completion date, and a download-PDF action. URL can be shared to LinkedIn, pasted in school applications, etc.
- Email arrives with subject "Congratulations — you completed {course title}" and a big "View your certificate" CTA.
- Re-completing a course (e.g., via `Take Again` re-enrollment) is a no-op on the completion row — original `verification_token` and `completed_at` preserved (idempotent upsert).

### 30.4 — Security + trust model

- Verification URL is public-by-token. 32 hex chars from `gen_random_bytes(16)` — unguessable (2^128 keyspace).
- No RLS on `SELECT` via token because service role is used; RLS enforces user-scoped reads for `/api/academy/my-courses`.
- Page is `robots: noindex, nofollow` so search engines can't enumerate certs.
- PDF's verification-URL footer lets paper copies be re-verified online.
- Not in scope: cryptographic signing of the PDF itself. A determined actor could fake a PDF; the verification URL is the authoritative source.

### 30.5 — Merge order

1. Run `psql ... -f supabase/migrations/183_course_completions.sql` against Supabase before merging.
2. Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in Vercel (already required by other admin-email flows — no new env var).
3. Merge `feat/academy-completion-certificates` to main.

### 30.6 — Verification

1. Create a test course with 2 lessons, enroll with a test user.
2. Complete lesson 1 → no completion callout (course not done).
3. Complete lesson 2 → "Course complete — certificate earned 🎓" callout renders with View button.
4. Check inbox — email arrives with the verification URL and a "View your certificate" CTA.
5. Open URL (Incognito or other browser) — no login required, cert renders with student + course + teacher + date.
6. Click "Download PDF" — landscape letter PDF downloads with branded layout.
7. Open a non-existent token URL → 404.
8. Visit `/academy/my-courses` → completed course shows "Certificate" button; click → same verification page.
9. `POST /api/academy/courses/[id]/complete` a second time for the same course → returns `completionAlreadyExisted: true` + same token.
10. As teacher: RLS query `SELECT * FROM course_completions WHERE course_id = '{yours}'` succeeds.

### 30.7 — What's NOT built (deferred)

- Puppeteer-rendered PDFs with full CSS fidelity — current client-side jspdf renders are adequate for v1; revisit if teachers demand richer templates.
- Cloudinary storage of generated PDFs — regenerating on demand is simpler and avoids stale-PDF issues if the template evolves.
- Certificate badge on user profile page — not scoped in plan 35. Add when profiles become more prominent.
- Third-party credential registries (Credly, Accredible) — track demand first.
- Template versioning / signed artifact — v1 trusts the verification URL as source of truth.

## 31. Plan 36 shipped — teacher cohort heatmap — `feat/teacher-cohort-heatmap`

Students × lessons grid on the teacher course page so an instructor can see where a cohort is stuck at a glance. Ships per plan 36 §2 (scope) + §3 (data shape) + §5 (UI component) + §6 (mount point).

### 31.1 — Files added

- [`app/api/academy/courses/[id]/cohort/route.ts`](../../app/api/academy/courses/%5Bid%5D/cohort/route.ts) — GET aggregate endpoint. Teacher-ownership or admin-bypass gated. Returns `{ course, students[], lessons[], progress[], summary }`:
  - `students`: enrollment rows joined to profiles, preserving enrolled-at order.
  - `lessons`: the course's lessons sorted by `order`.
  - `progress`: **full grid emission** (student × lesson rows, with synthetic `not_started` cells for missing progress rows). Keeps the client render simple — no missing-cell handling. ≤ 200 students × 20 lessons = 4,000 rows, cheap.
  - `summary`: `enrolled_count`, `active_count`, `avg_completion_pct`, `median_time_to_complete_days` (among students who finished every lesson), `most_stuck_lesson_id` (fewest completions, ties broken by earliest order).
  - Single round-trip per entity (enrollments / lessons / progress / profiles), all in parallel via `Promise.all`.
- [`components/academy/teacher/CohortHeatmap.tsx`](../../components/academy/teacher/CohortHeatmap.tsx) — presentational. Sticky-left student-name column, scrolling lesson columns on mobile. Cell states: gray (not started) / amber (in progress) / green (completed), with a quiz-score overlay on quiz cells. `role="grid"` on the table, `role="gridcell"` + `aria-label` on each cell so screen readers announce "{student}: {lesson} — {state}". The most-stuck lesson's column header gets a subtle red tint. Uses a `useMemo`-cached lookup map for O(1) cell access during render.
- [`app/dashboard/teaching/courses/[id]/cohort/page.tsx`](../../app/dashboard/teaching/courses/%5Bid%5D/cohort/page.tsx) — client page. Fetches the endpoint, renders loader / error / empty-state / heatmap. Summary-stat cards above the grid. "Export CSV" button: builds a local CSV of rows = students, columns = lessons, cells = `'' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'completed (78%)'` (for quizzes). Filename: `{course-slug}-cohort-{date}.csv`.

### 31.2 — Files modified

- [`components/academy/course-editor/CourseEditorLayout.tsx`](../../components/academy/course-editor/CourseEditorLayout.tsx) — action bar gains a "Cohort" link (Users icon) before Assignments + Preview. One line of nav, zero interference with existing tab state.

### 31.3 — Behavior

- Teacher visits `/dashboard/teaching/courses/{id}` → clicks "Cohort" in the header action bar.
- Cohort page loads → fetches `/api/academy/courses/{id}/cohort` → renders summary cards + heatmap + legend.
- Rows = enrolled students (cancelled enrollments are 50% opacity, labeled "cancelled").
- Columns = lessons in order. Lesson with the fewest completions gets a red-tinted header.
- Each cell: green if that student completed that lesson (with checkmark icon), amber if started (clock icon), gray if not started (circle icon). Quiz cells show the numeric score instead of an icon.
- Hover any cell → tooltip with student name, lesson title, state, completion date (for completed) or score (for quizzes).
- Click "Export CSV" → downloads the full grid for offline analysis (Excel / Sheets).

### 31.4 — Empty states + edge cases

- No students yet: heatmap hides; summary cards + an "Award" empty-state replace the grid with copy nudging the teacher to wait for enrollments.
- No lessons yet: course has no structure to rank students against; we still render the students column, and `most_stuck_lesson_id` is null.
- A student with a re-enrollment (`attempt_number > 1`): row shows "attempt 2" in a small subtitle.
- Quiz cells: if the student has a `quiz_score`, we render that number instead of the state icon — teachers see completion AND performance at a glance.

### 31.5 — Performance

- Single course load. Endpoint does 4 queries in parallel (enrollments, lessons, lesson_progress, profiles). No N+1.
- Client render: `useMemo`-cached lookup map built once from the flat progress array. O(students × lessons) render without re-mapping every cell.
- Scale ceiling: plan 36 noted "cap initial query at 200 students." BVC is nowhere near that; defer pagination until it matters.

### 31.6 — Out of scope (future)

Per plan 36 §2:

- Per-question quiz analytics (which questions most missed). Separate plan.
- Engagement predictions / ML. Premature.
- Email-student-nudge-on-stuck. Separate plan; needs opt-in design.
- Attempt-history view (see student's earlier attempts). Currently collapses to latest.

### 31.7 — Merge order

1. Branch is off main. No plan dependencies.
2. No migrations, no env vars, no API dependencies.
3. Merge `feat/teacher-cohort-heatmap`.

### 31.8 — Verification

1. As teacher with a course that has ≥ 1 enrolled student → visit `/dashboard/teaching/courses/{id}/cohort` (or click "Cohort" from the course editor header).
2. Summary stats render (enrolled count, avg completion, median time, most-stuck lesson).
3. Heatmap shows one row per student, one column per lesson.
4. Hover a cell → tooltip with full student-lesson-state description.
5. Click "Export CSV" → downloads `{course-slug}-cohort-{date}.csv`; opens in Sheets with one row per student + one column per lesson.
6. Empty-state: create a new course with no enrollments → visit cohort page → Award icon + "No enrolled students yet" copy.
7. As non-owner (different teacher) → visit the same URL → 403.
8. Mobile viewport → student-name column stays pinned, lesson columns scroll horizontally.

## 32. Plan 34 Phase A shipped — magic-link login UX — `feat/auth-magic-link-phase-a`

First of four phases (A–D) in plan 34's magic-link migration. Phase A surfaces the magic link that Supabase has been silently including in its OTP emails this whole time — renames the tab, clarifies the dual-path copy (link OR code), and adds a session listener so clicking the link in another tab redirects the original tab. No forced migration: password login and code entry still work identically. Behind a feature flag for rapid rollback.

### 32.1 — What was already there

Key finding: Supabase's `signInWithOtp({ email, options: { shouldCreateUser: false } })` has been wired on `/login` since the OTP tab shipped, and the default email template already includes BOTH a 6-digit code AND a clickable magic link. The callback route at `/auth/callback` already handles the PKCE exchange. Users who clicked the link have been signing in correctly — they just weren't told the link existed.

**Net effect of Phase A: UX clarity + session-aware redirect. No new Supabase method calls, no email template changes.**

### 32.2 — Files modified

- [`app/login/page.tsx`](../../app/login/page.tsx):
  - Top comment rewritten to reflect the dual-path model.
  - New `EMAIL_AUTH_ENABLED` constant (reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_EMAIL_ENABLED`, defaults on). Hides the email-sign-in tab entirely when set to `'false'` — rolls back via env change without a code deploy.
  - Tab label renamed "Email Code" → "Email link".
  - Email-form helper copy changed from "We'll send a 6-digit code" → "We'll email you a sign-in link and a backup 6-digit code — use whichever is easier."
  - Submit button label "Send Code" → "Send sign-in link".
  - Post-send screen: replaced the plain "enter the 6-digit code" heading with a sky-themed info box that calls out two paths: **Easiest**: click the link in the email (auto-redirects); **Or**: enter the 6-digit code below. The code-entry field label is demoted to "(optional if you clicked the link)".
  - New `useEffect` that listens for `onAuthStateChange` events while the user is on the code-entry step. When `SIGNED_IN` fires (e.g., the user clicked the link in another tab), the original tab redirects to the dashboard — or routes to MFA if aal2 is required. Subscription cleanup on tab switch or unmount.

### 32.3 — Behavior

- User visits `/login` → Password tab selected by default (unchanged).
- Clicks "Email link" tab → form asks for email, helper text mentions both paths.
- Submits → sky info box replaces the form: "Check your inbox — {email}. Easiest: click the sign-in link. Or: enter the 6-digit code below."
- Path A (link click in same tab): browser navigates to `/auth/callback` → exchanges code → redirects to dashboard.
- Path B (link click in another tab/browser/device): that tab signs in. The original tab's auth listener fires `SIGNED_IN`, runs MFA check, and redirects to dashboard within ~1 second.
- Path C (type code into original tab): existing `verifyOtp` flow, unchanged.
- Setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_EMAIL_ENABLED=false` in Vercel: email-sign-in tab hides; users see only password login. No redeploy needed beyond env var propagation.

### 32.4 — What's NOT in Phase A (by design)

Per plan 34:

- **Phase B:** magic-link becomes the default path on `/signup`. Password signup hidden behind an expander.
- **Phase C:** magic-link becomes the default on `/login` too (password hidden behind expander).
- **Phase D:** 30-day delivery-reliability watch window, then treat magic-link as the primary path.

Each phase is its own deploy + watch. Phase A is conservative — no user is forced off password login, and the tab can be hidden entirely via env flag.

### 32.5 — Verification

1. `/login` → Password tab works unchanged.
2. Email link tab → enters email → submits → confirmation screen with dual-path copy.
3. Check inbox → email includes both a link and a 6-digit code.
4. Same-tab link click → callback → dashboard.
5. Cross-tab link click → tab A auto-redirects to dashboard within ~1 second.
6. Code entry still works unchanged.
7. `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_EMAIL_ENABLED=false` → reload → email tab hidden.
8. MFA-enabled users still flow through the MFA verify step.

### 32.6 — Merge order

1. Merge `feat/auth-magic-link-phase-a` to main. No migrations, no new env vars (flag is optional, defaults on).
2. Optional: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_EMAIL_ENABLED` in Vercel for an operational rollback path.
3. Watch Resend delivery for ~1 week before opening Phase B.

## 33. Plan 31 Phase 1 shipped — i18n infra + SEO hreflang — `feat/i18n-seo-phase-1`

Proof-of-concept i18n on home + pricing with cookie-based locale switching. Infrastructure is hand-rolled (no `next-intl`) to avoid a big npm dependency for Phase 1 — if Phase 2+ needs richer features (ICU pluralization, relative-time formatting), migrate then.

**Scope choice:** plan 31 recommended prefixed URLs (`/en/*`, `/es/*`) for SEO. Phase 1 ships cookie-based detection instead — preserves every existing URL, proves the pattern on one surface, and defers the URL-scheme migration to Phase 2 when multiple surfaces are ready to switch at once. hreflang alternates are still set at the root; SEO juice stays with the canonical URLs for now.

### 33.1 — Files added

- [`lib/i18n/config.ts`](../../lib/i18n/config.ts) — `LOCALES`, `DEFAULT_LOCALE`, `LOCALE_COOKIE`, `isSupportedLocale`, `pickLocaleFromAcceptLanguage`, `LOCALE_LABELS`. Minimal constants module so a future next-intl migration only has to remap a few names.
- [`lib/i18n/server.ts`](../../lib/i18n/server.ts) — `getLocale()` reads cookie first → Accept-Language fallback → `DEFAULT_LOCALE`. `getTranslations(namespace)` returns a `t(key)` function with English-fallback-then-key-self chain so missing keys never render as `undefined`. `getDictionary(namespace)` returns the merged EN+target dict for bundle-into-client use. Marked `'server-only'`.
- [`lib/i18n/client.tsx`](../../lib/i18n/client.tsx) — `<LocaleProvider>` React context, `useLocale()`, `useTranslations(namespace)`, `buildLocaleBundle()` helper. Server layout resolves, client components consume. ~1 KB gzipped total per locale payload.
- `locales/en/{common,home,pricing}.json` — authoritative English copy.
- `locales/es/{common,home,pricing}.json` — first-pass Spanish translations (machine-style; human review recommended per plan 31 §6).
- [`components/i18n/LanguageToggle.tsx`](../../components/i18n/LanguageToggle.tsx) — dropdown (Globe icon + EN/ES). POSTs choice to `/api/i18n/set-locale`, then `router.refresh()` so the server layout re-renders with the new cookie.
- [`app/api/i18n/set-locale/route.ts`](../../app/api/i18n/set-locale/route.ts) — POST endpoint. Validates against `LOCALES`, writes `centos_locale` cookie with 1-year TTL, path=/, SameSite=Lax.

### 33.2 — Files modified

- [`app/layout.tsx`](../../app/layout.tsx):
  - `RootLayout` is now async — `await getLocale()` + dictionary loads.
  - `<html lang="en">` → `<html lang={locale}>`.
  - Wraps `ToastProvider` in `<LocaleProvider value={bundle}>` so every nested client component gets the dictionaries.
  - Added `alternates.languages` to the site metadata so the home page emits `<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en"...>` + `es` + `x-default`. Phase 1 points all three to the same URL (cookie-based); Phase 2 will point to prefixed URLs.
- [`app/page.tsx`](../../app/page.tsx):
  - `useTranslations('home')` + `useLocale()` hooks.
  - Hero subtitle + three CTA buttons (Start Your Journey / Try the Demo / View Tech Roadmap) now use translation keys.
  - `<LanguageToggle>` added to the desktop nav after the primary CTA.
- [`app/pricing/page.tsx`](../../app/pricing/page.tsx): `useTranslations('pricing')` hook; `<h1>` title and subtitle use translation keys. (Other copy on this page remains English — scope trim for Phase 1.)
- [`app/sitemap.ts`](../../app/sitemap.ts) — imports `LOCALES` for future hreflang expansion; existing 200+-route sitemap untouched. Per-URL language alternates come in Phase 2 when URL scheme changes.

### 33.3 — Behavior

- Fresh visitor with `Accept-Language: es-MX,es;q=0.9,en;q=0.8` → home renders in Spanish, `<html lang="es">`.
- Visitor clicks the Globe → dropdown → "English" → cookie set → page refresh → home renders in English.
- Cookie persists across sessions (1-year TTL). Logged-in and anonymous users both see the same locale behavior.
- Existing URLs unchanged. Search engines see hreflang alternates at the site level pointing to the same canonical URLs — acceptable for Phase 1, replaced with prefixed alternates in Phase 2.
- All dashboard / teacher / academy routes stay English-only for now. The infrastructure is ready to extend them; scope creep is the only obstacle.

### 33.4 — Deferred to Phase 2 (per plan 31 §3)

- Prefixed URL scheme (`/en/*`, `/es/*`) with middleware-based locale routing.
- Migration of public blog, recipes, academy catalog, course detail, teacher profile, coaching, features pages.
- schema.org/Article, schema.org/Course JSON-LD generation per locale.
- OG image variants per locale.
- Human review of Spanish translations.

### 33.5 — Deferred to Phase 3

Dashboard authenticated surfaces — largest string count, ~70% of the app.

### 33.6 — Deferred to Phase 4

Error boundaries, transactional emails, legal pages.

### 33.7 — Migration note — why in-house not next-intl

Plan 31 recommended `next-intl` but allowed a custom fallback. Phase 1 ships in-house because:

- No new npm dependency needed (owner's school network blocks npm; every new package adds a delay to local dev feedback).
- Phase 1 strings are static — we don't need `next-intl`'s richer features (ICU pluralization, date/number formatting, namespace auto-splitting) yet.
- The API surface (`useTranslations`, `getLocale`, `getTranslations`) mirrors `next-intl`'s so a swap in Phase 2+ is a 1-hour refactor, not a rewrite.

### 33.8 — Merge order

1. Branch is off main. No migrations, no env vars.
2. Merge `feat/i18n-seo-phase-1` to main.
3. Watch for ~48 hours for any server-component render regressions before opening Phase 2.

### 33.9 — Verification

1. Fresh Incognito with browser language Spanish → visit `/` → Spanish copy + `<html lang="es">`.
2. Click the Globe in the top nav → select "English" → page reloads in English.
3. Cookie inspection: `centos_locale=en`, Max-Age=31536000.
4. Visit `/pricing` in Spanish → heading and subtitle translated; rest of the page remains English (Phase 1 scope).
5. View-source on `/` → `<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" ... />` + `es` + `x-default` in `<head>`.
6. `Accept-Language: es` + no cookie → Spanish.
7. `Accept-Language: en` + cookie `centos_locale=es` → Spanish (cookie has priority).

## 34. Plan 31 Phase 2 shipped — prefixed locale URLs + per-URL hreflang — `feat/i18n-seo-phase-2`

Adds the URL-scheme piece plan 31 originally recommended (prefixed `/en/*` + `/es/*`) via middleware rewrites rather than a full route-tree migration. Existing URLs keep working (English default, served canonically); new `/es/*` URLs render in Spanish. Search engines see two URL sets per page with mutual hreflang alternates.

### 34.1 — Design choices

- **Rewrite over redirect:** middleware rewrites `/es/pricing` internally to `/pricing`, sets `x-locale: es` on the request headers, and refreshes the locale cookie. The browser URL stays `/es/pricing`; the server renders the same components but `getLocale()` returns `'es'`. Zero page-tree duplication.
- **EN is canonical un-prefixed:** every existing bookmark, share, and back-link keeps working and retains its link equity. ES URLs are the only ones that need the prefix.
- **URL prefix wins over cookie:** if a user with cookie=en follows a link to `/es/pricing`, they see Spanish. Sender's explicit intent beats recipient's saved default.
- **Sitemap emits both variants per route** with cross-linked hreflang alternates — what Google's spec asks for.

### 34.2 — Files modified

- [`middleware.ts`](../../middleware.ts):
  - `LOCALE_PREFIX_RE` regex compiled at module load.
  - First branch of `middleware()`: on a locale-prefixed URL, rewrite to the un-prefixed path + set `x-locale` header + refresh the cookie. Returns immediately.
  - Early-return `NextResponse.next()` for public non-prefixed, non-auth routes so the Supabase auth call doesn't run for every marketing page.
  - Matcher expanded to `['/((?!_next/static|_next/image|api/|favicon|.*\\..*).*)']`. Auth work stays pathname-gated.
- [`lib/i18n/server.ts`](../../lib/i18n/server.ts):
  - `getLocale()` priority: header → cookie → Accept-Language → default.
  - `Namespace` union expanded to include `blog` + `academy`. DICTS map updated.
- [`components/i18n/LanguageToggle.tsx`](../../components/i18n/LanguageToggle.tsx):
  - Rewritten: navigates to the locale-prefixed URL instead of POST+refresh. Strips existing prefix, preserves query string. Middleware handles the cookie via the rewrite. Old POST endpoint stays for server-action use.
- [`app/layout.tsx`](../../app/layout.tsx): bundles all five namespaces (common, home, pricing, blog, academy) into the `LocaleProvider` value.
- [`app/sitemap.ts`](../../app/sitemap.ts): refactored static routes into `STATIC_PATHS` array; `localizedUrl(path, locale)` + `alternatesFor(path)` helpers emit one entry per locale per route with `x-default` + `en` + `es` alternates.

### 34.3 — Files added

- [`locales/en/blog.json`](../../locales/en/blog.json) + [`locales/es/blog.json`](../../locales/es/blog.json) — blog landing dictionary.
- [`locales/en/academy.json`](../../locales/en/academy.json) + [`locales/es/academy.json`](../../locales/es/academy.json) — Academy catalog dictionary.

### 34.4 — Behavior

- `/es/pricing` → middleware rewrites to `/pricing` + sets `x-locale: es` + cookie → pricing page renders in Spanish.
- `/pricing` (no prefix) → cookie or Accept-Language decides the locale.
- Globe toggle on `/pricing` → navigates to `/es/pricing` (and back).
- Bookmarked `/es/pricing` reloads in Spanish regardless of prior cookie.
- Sitemap lists each public route twice, with mutual hreflang alternates.

### 34.5 — What's NOT in Phase 2 (by design)

Deferred to Phase 2B branches:

- Full string migration of public blog, blog post detail, course detail, teacher profile, coaching, features pages. **Dictionaries now exist** for blog + academy; migrating the page JSX is an incremental per-file pass.
- schema.org JSON-LD (Article, Course, Person, Recipe). Extend `lib/seo/json-ld.ts` in Phase 2B.
- Per-locale OG image variants.
- Human review of Spanish translations (still machine-style first pass).

### 34.6 — Perf footprint

Middleware now runs on every HTML URL. Added work: one regex match (~microseconds); for locale-prefixed URLs add a header clone + cookie set + internal rewrite; for non-prefixed non-auth URLs immediate `NextResponse.next()`. Auth flow unchanged — Supabase call still pathname-gated. No measurable overhead for non-auth routes.

### 34.7 — Verification

1. `/es/pricing` → URL stays, Spanish title + subtitle, `<html lang="es">`.
2. `/pricing` fresh → English (or Spanish if Accept-Language=es).
3. Cookie=es + `/pricing` → Spanish.
4. Cookie=es + `/en/pricing` → English (URL prefix wins).
5. Globe on `/pricing` → `/es/pricing`. Globe on `/es/pricing` → `/pricing`.
6. `/pricing?from=signup` → `/es/pricing?from=signup` (query preserved).
7. `/sitemap.xml` lists both variants per route with alternates.
8. `/es/nonexistent` → 404 (rewrite to `/nonexistent`, normal 404).
9. Auth flow: `/dashboard/planner` still redirects unauth to login; MFA unchanged.

### 34.8 — Merge order

1. Branch stacked on `feat/i18n-seo-phase-1`. Merge Phase 1 first if not yet.
2. Merge `feat/i18n-seo-phase-2`.
3. Resubmit sitemap in Google Search Console for re-crawl.
