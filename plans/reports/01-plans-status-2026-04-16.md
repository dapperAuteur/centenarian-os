## 2. Backlog (written, not started)

Each has a matching `plans/validate/NN-slug.md` sign-off file.

| # | Plan | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 24 | Academy 360° transcripts | small (~2 days) | Extract shared `TranscriptPanel`; wire into `Lesson360VideoPlayer`. No migration needed. |
| 25 | Academy 360° offline caching | medium (~1 week) | Service Worker + IndexedDB. Migration 179 is taken; next is 180. iOS Safari blob test flagged as risk. |
| 26 | Academy Insta360 import | medium, **blocked** | §3 external research required before coding (SDK availability, NDA, usage data). May collapse into a drag-and-drop one-day feature. |
| 27 | Academy media library | large (~2 weeks) | Per-teacher library with naming, tagging, fuzzy search, delete/replace. Migration 181. |
| 28 | — | **deleted** | Was destinations/scenes search; belonged to the Wanderlearn project. |
| 29 | Error handling UI/UX/DX | medium | Custom 404/500 pages, error boundaries, toast system, analytics 404 suppression. |

---

## 3. Infrastructure & open blockers

- **Migrations 175–179** must be applied to the deployment. Running 179 is the most recent ask.
- **Analytics 404** at `/a/script.js` and `/a/api/send` — `next.config.mjs` rewrites for PostHog/Plausible are misconfigured or the service endpoint changed. **Not a code issue.** Plan 29 covers graceful handling.
- **School network npm install** — `lightspeed.hseschools.org` intercepts `registry.npmjs.org` and returns HTML, breaking `npm install`. User works around this from home. Type shims were used once (plan 23a) and removed once plugins landed.
- **Cloudinary env var** — set `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix) on Vercel and locally. `next.config.mjs` aliases it to `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` at build time for the upload widget.

---

## 4. Documentation state

- [STYLE_GUIDE.md](../../STYLE_GUIDE.md) — collaboration rules
- [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) — code style and a11y mandates
- `plans/NN-slug.md` — 9 active plans (20–27, 29), 1 deleted (28)
- `plans/validate/NN-slug.md` — validation checklists for each plan
- `content/tutorials/academy/14-360-video-lessons.md` — learner tutorial for 360° lessons
- `content/tutorials/teaching/16-publishing-360-videos.md` — teacher tutorial

---

## 5. Recommended next actions

In order of priority:

1. **Run migration 179** if not already applied (`tour_progress JSONB` on `lesson_progress`).
2. **Plan 24 (360° transcripts)** — smallest remaining piece in the 360° arc; extracts the shared TranscriptPanel and wires it into the video player. Estimated 2 days.
3. **Plan 29 (error handling)** — user-surfaced need after the "black screen on error" report. Medium effort.
4. **Plan 27 (media library)** — large but high-value: naming/tagging/search solves the "LRV_20260408_164622_01_015" readability problem.
5. **Plan 25 (offline)** or **Plan 26 (Insta360)** — defer until 24/27 land and 26's research is unblocked.

---

## 6. Session outcome

### Style guide update — `docs/style-guide-stricter-branching-rule` (`56cccb0`)

Committed to `docs/style-guide-stricter-branching-rule` on 2026-04-16. Awaiting user merge to `main`.

**Files changed (2 insertions, 0 deletions):**

- `STYLE_GUIDE.md` — +18 lines
  - New **§0 "The golden rule: branch first, commit last"** at the top of the document. Spells out the exact five-step workflow (checkout main → pull → branch → edit → commit), names the recovery move for anyone who catches themselves editing on `main` (stash + branch + pop + continue), and states "No exceptions, no direct commits to main, no 'it's just a tiny fix.'"
  - §3 Conventional Commits prefaced with an explicit instruction: **write the commit message at the END of the work**, describing the changes that were actually made — not intent, not ticket title, not plan. Rewrite the body if the diff disagrees.
- `CLAUDE.md` — +2 lines
  - Added a second blockquote at the top summarizing the golden rule with a link to STYLE_GUIDE.md §0, so readers who open the code-style doc first also see the workflow rule.

**Tests:** docs-only change, no typecheck needed (confirmed clean anyway).

**Commit message (actual):**
```
docs(style): make branch-first + descriptive-commit rules unmissable
```
with a three-paragraph body describing the §0 addition, the §3 preface, and the CLAUDE.md link-back.

### Impact on existing plans

None of the plans 20–29 require edits — they were already written and executed assuming these rules were in effect. The update codifies what was already practiced, closes the ambiguity for the next contributor, and gives future-me a clear line to point at if anyone tries to commit to `main`.

### What to do next (unchanged from §5 above)

1. Merge `docs/style-guide-stricter-branching-rule` (`56cccb0`) to `main`. ✓ **Done.**
2. Run migration 179 if not already applied.
3. Proceed with plan 24 (360° transcripts) as the smallest remaining item in the 360° arc. ✓ **Done — see §7 below.**

---

## 7. Plan 24 shipped — `feat/academy-360-transcripts` (`c199b89`)

Committed 2026-04-16. Awaiting user merge to `main`.

**Files changed (5 files, +160 / −93 lines):**

- `components/academy/TranscriptPanel.tsx` (new, 97 lines) — extracted shared transcript UI with click-to-seek, auto-scroll to active segment, and `aria-live="polite"` announcements. Takes `{ transcript, currentTime, onSeek, onCollapse }`.
- `components/academy/VideoPlayer.tsx` (−32 lines net) — removed inline transcript JSX + `transcriptRef` + auto-scroll effect; renders `<TranscriptPanel>` when toggled. No behavior change.
- `components/academy/AudioPlayer.tsx` (−38 lines net) — same refactor. No behavior change.
- `components/academy/Lesson360VideoPlayer.tsx` (+43 lines) — new optional `transcript` prop; VideoPlugin reference captured in a ref so TranscriptPanel's `onSeek` can call `plugin.setTime()`; `currentTime` state updated in the existing 'progress' event listener; new transcript toggle button overlayed top-right on the player; renders `<TranscriptPanel>` below when toggled.
- `app/academy/[courseId]/lessons/[lessonId]/page.tsx` — passes `lesson.transcript_content` through to `Lesson360VideoPlayer` (Lesson type already had `transcript_content` from plan 23).

**No migration. No new env vars. No new packages.** Typecheck clean.

**Behavior delivered:**

- A 360° video lesson whose `transcript_content` JSONB is populated now shows a document-icon toggle in the top-right of the player. Tapping it slides out the shared transcript panel below the player.
- Active segment highlights in fuchsia and auto-scrolls into view as the video plays (same behavior as flat video).
- Clicking a transcript segment calls `VideoPlugin.setTime(segment.startTime)`, seeking the 360° video to that timestamp. The pan orientation is preserved (learner stays looking at the same point in the scene).
- `VideoPlayer` and `AudioPlayer` continue to behave identically to before this branch, just with less code duplication.

**Impact on other plans:**

- Plan 25 (offline caching) — the shared TranscriptPanel is a natural candidate for caching alongside the media; worth a mention in plan 25's validation.
- Plan 27 (media library) — unaffected.
- Plan 29 (error handling) — TranscriptPanel is a leaf component with no error paths beyond parent props; no change needed.

### Remaining backlog (unchanged priorities)

- Plan 25 (offline) — medium, ~1 week
- Plan 27 (media library) — large, ~2 weeks
- Plan 29 (error handling UX) — medium
- Plan 26 (Insta360) — blocked on §3 research

## 8. Plan 29 shipped — `feat/error-handling-ux` (`41ea63a`)

Committed 2026-04-16. Awaiting user merge to `main`.

**Files changed (7 files, +512 / −12 lines):**

- `app/error.tsx` (new) — client error boundary catching uncaught errors below `/app`. Branded card with "Try again" (calls `reset()`) + "Go home" actions, shows Next.js error digest.
- `app/global-error.tsx` (new) — last-resort boundary for errors inside the root layout. Dependency-free, inline styles only (globals.css may not have loaded when this fires).
- `app/academy/error.tsx` (new) — academy-specific boundary with "Your progress is safe" copy and "Back to Academy" link. Takes precedence over `app/error.tsx` for `/academy/*`.
- `app/dashboard/error.tsx` (new) — dashboard-specific boundary using the dark palette so dashboard pages don't flash from dark to light on error.
- `lib/error-logging.ts` (new) — single `logError(err, { module, digest, context })` entry point. Dev emits grouped console output; prod emits single-line JSON prefixed `[centos-error]` for log aggregators. One place to add Sentry later.
- `components/ui/ToastProvider.tsx` (new) — custom lightweight toast system. `useToast()` hook exposes `success` / `error` / `info` / `dismiss`. Success + info auto-dismiss after 5s; errors stick (users need to actually read them). `aria-live="polite"`; error-kind toasts get `role="alert"`.
- `app/layout.tsx` — wraps children in `<ToastProvider>`; tightens the Umami analytics script condition so `/a/script.js` only mounts when `NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_SCRIPT_URL` or `UMAMI_HOST_URL` is set (previously it mounted whenever the site ID was present, causing the `/a/script.js` and `/a/api/send` 404s in dev).

**Existing `app/not-found.tsx` was adequate and was left untouched.**

### Behavior delivered

- Any uncaught error below `/app/` renders the branded `app/error.tsx` recovery surface instead of a black screen. Academy routes get the academy-specific version; dashboard routes get the dark-themed version.
- Errors in the root layout itself fall through to `app/global-error.tsx` with inline styles, so the UI still comes up even if globals.css or the layout provider tree is broken.
- Every boundary logs the error through the shared `logError` helper so future Sentry integration is a one-file change.
- Toast system is mounted globally; any client component can now call `useToast()` and surface success/error/info messages without writing a mini-provider per feature.
- Umami analytics 404 noise in dev is gone — the script only mounts when there's actually somewhere for it to go.

### Impact on other plans

- **Plan 27 (media library)** — can use `useToast()` for upload/delete/replace feedback without wiring its own notification layer.
- **Plan 25 (offline caching)** — failed fetches should call `useToast().error('You\u2019re offline')` for instant feedback.
- **All future features** — use `logError()` instead of bare `console.error()` so production logs stay greppable.

### Follow-up work (not in this branch)

- A global CSS rewrite returning 204 for `/a/script.js` would be belt-and-suspenders for the analytics suppression. The `next.config.mjs` approach wasn't strictly needed once the layout condition was tightened — the 404 no longer happens.
- `useToast()` adoption sweep: replace scattered `console.error` + silent-catch patterns across the app with toasts. Follow-up branch after this ships.

### Remaining backlog (unchanged priorities)

- Plan 25 (offline) — medium, ~1 week
- Plan 27 (media library) — large, ~2 weeks
- Plan 26 (Insta360) — blocked on §3 research

## 9. Plan 27a shipped — `feat/academy-media-library-foundation` (`4056efb`)

Committed 2026-04-16. Awaiting user merge to `main`. **Migration 180 must run after merge.**

Plan 27 split into two branches per the plan's own guidance; this is 27a (foundation). Plan 27b (search + tags + picker) is the next queued item.

**Files changed (10 files, +935 / −1 lines):**

- `supabase/migrations/180_media_assets.sql` (new) — `media_assets` table keyed by `(owner_id, cloudinary_public_id)`. `pg_trgm` extension + GIN indexes on `name` (trigram) and `tags` so plan 27b's fuzzy search already has its indexes. RLS: owner-only.
- `lib/academy/media-types.ts` (new) — `MediaAsset`, `MediaAssetReference`, `AssetKind` types.
- `app/api/academy/media/route.ts` (new) — GET list (owner-scoped, optional `kind` filter), POST upsert on `(owner_id, public_id)`.
- `app/api/academy/media/[id]/route.ts` (new) — PATCH name/description/tags, DELETE with 409 + reference count when any lesson still uses the URL.
- `app/api/academy/media/[id]/references/route.ts` (new) — lists lessons referencing the asset via `content_url` or `video_360_poster_url`, each tagged with the matching field.
- `app/dashboard/teaching/media/page.tsx` (new) — mount point.
- `components/academy/media-library/MediaLibrary.tsx` (new) — top-level container with list/select/save/delete/references wiring; uses `useToast()` for user-visible errors and `logError()` for structured logging.
- `components/academy/media-library/MediaGrid.tsx` (new) — responsive 2/3/4-column thumbnail grid. Image/panorama_image show their own URL; videos show the Cloudinary `so_0` first-frame transform; audio/document/other get icon tiles.
- `components/academy/media-library/MediaDetailPanel.tsx` (new) — right-side panel with editable name/description/tags, read-only metadata, Cloudinary link, collapsible "Lessons using this asset" (lazy-loaded), delete with explicit "Cloudinary file untouched" note.
- `components/academy/Cloudinary360Uploader.tsx` — fire-and-forget POST to `/api/academy/media` after a successful upload. Failures are swallowed + logged via `logError` so they never block the lesson save path. Existing `onUploadSuccess` callback signature is unchanged — no caller edits needed.

### Behavior delivered

- Every 360° upload a teacher makes through `Cloudinary360Uploader` now registers automatically in the library with filename, dimensions, duration, and byte size. Existing 360° lessons that uploaded before this branch won't retroactively appear (one-time backfill is a separate task if you want it).
- Navigating to `/dashboard/teaching/media` shows the library as a grid of thumbnails. Click a tile → right-side panel opens with the full asset details.
- Rename an asset ("IMG_20260411_143022_001" → "Main hall walkthrough"), add a description and tags, save → the grid tile updates.
- Delete an asset with no references → gone. Delete one that's referenced → blocked with "Can't delete — this asset is referenced by N lessons. Unwire those lessons first."
- "Lessons using this asset" expands into a clickable list of the exact lesson + course pairs, each tagged content/poster so the teacher knows where to find it.
- All error paths toast via `useToast()` (plan 29's system) and log structured via `logError()` — zero bare `console.error()` calls.

### Plan 27b (deferred to next branch)

- **Fuzzy search** — Fuse.js over name + description + tags. Indexes already exist in the DB; 27b just needs the client integration and a search bar in the library header.
- **Tag filter chips** — clickable chips in the header that narrow the grid to assets carrying the selected tag(s).
- **"Pick from library" button** — new flow in the CurriculumTab URL input for 360° lesson types. Opens a `MediaPickerModal` that reuses the grid + search.
- **Replace-file action** — upload a new version of an existing asset; all referring lessons auto-pick-up the new URL via `media_assets` join (design decision pending — simpler path may be to keep the public_id stable and overwrite, so content_url doesn't even need to change).

### Merge order

1. Merge `feat/error-handling-ux` (`41ea63a`) first — media library imports `useToast` and `logError` from it.
2. Merge `feat/academy-media-library-foundation` (`4056efb`).
3. Run `psql ... -f supabase/migrations/180_media_assets.sql`.
4. Visit `/dashboard/teaching/media` — empty state.
5. Upload a 360° asset via any existing lesson → refresh the library page → the asset appears.

---

## 10. Plan 27b shipped — `feat/academy-media-library-search-picker` (`fa5f4cf`)

Committed 2026-04-16. Awaiting user merge to `main`. **Run `npm install` from a working network before merging** — the school Lightspeed filter blocked `fuse.js` the same way it blocked PSV plugins during plan 23a. Package.json references the dep; a local type shim keeps `tsc` green until the real package lands.

Plan 27 is now fully shipped (27a foundation + 27b this branch).

**Files changed (7 files, +484 / −8 lines):**

- `lib/academy/media-search.ts` (new) — `filterAssets(assets, query, tags)` combines AND-tag-filter with fuzzy Fuse.js search over name/description/tags. `uniqueTags()` returns the sorted distinct set. Threshold 0.4, minMatchCharLength 2, ignoreLocation — tuned for a teacher's library of a few hundred files.
- `components/academy/media-library/MediaFilterBar.tsx` (new) — shared search input + tag chip row. Controlled props so MediaLibrary and MediaPickerModal each own their own filter state independently. `aria-live` on the result-count so screen readers pick up filtering.
- `components/academy/media-library/MediaPickerModal.tsx` (new) — reusable modal wrapping the grid + filter bar. Accepts `allowedKinds` to pre-filter (e.g. `['panorama_video']` for a 360° video lesson). Fires `onPick(asset)` with the full `MediaAsset`; caller handles state change + close.
- `types/fuse-js-shim.d.ts` (new) — local module shim. Same dev-network workaround as plan 23a's PSV shim. Delete once `npm install` lands the real types.
- `components/academy/media-library/MediaLibrary.tsx` — adds `query` + `selectedTags` state, wires `MediaFilterBar`, uses `filterAssets()` to drive the grid. Empty-filter-result renders a dashed placeholder.
- `components/academy/course-editor/CurriculumTab.tsx` — single `pickerState` drives one `MediaPickerModal` shared across all four 360° upload sites (add × video, add × photo, edit × video, edit × photo). "Pick from library" button renders next to each `Cloudinary360Uploader` for 360° lesson types. Picking sets both `content_url` and the derived `video_360_poster_url`.
- `package.json` — adds `fuse.js` at `^7.0.0`.

### Behavior delivered

- The library page header now has a search input (name + description + tags, fuzzy) and a row of clickable tag chips. Both filters compose — search inside a tag-filtered subset. "Clear filters" link appears when any filter is active and the result count differs from the total.
- In the teacher course editor, every 360° upload site (add/edit × video/photo) has a new **"Pick from library"** button below the Cloudinary upload button. Clicking opens a modal with the library pre-filtered to matching `asset_kind` (`panorama_video` or `panorama_image`). Pick → modal closes → the lesson's content_url + poster fill in.
- The picker is the fast path to reuse: a teacher with 30 MUCHO Museo panoramas can now stamp any of them into a new lesson without re-uploading.

### Merge order (updated)

1. **Run `npm install` from home** to pull `fuse.js`. Confirm `node_modules/fuse.js` exists before pushing the merge.
2. Merge `fa5f4cf` to `main`.
3. Delete `types/fuse-js-shim.d.ts` in a tiny follow-up `chore/` commit once `npm ls fuse.js` confirms the real package is present.

### Plan 27 follow-ups NOT in this branch

- **Replace-file action** — upload a new version of an existing asset. Options: (a) overwrite Cloudinary at same public_id so URL stays stable and referring lessons auto-pickup, (b) new public_id + UPDATE all referring lesson rows in a transaction. Deferred; low-priority until a teacher asks.
- **Kind filter in UI** — the API already supports `?kind=`; the library page doesn't expose a UI control. Add if teachers with mixed libraries ask.
- **Chip-input for tags** — plan 27a's detail panel uses a comma-separated text input. Parse-on-Enter chip-input would be nicer polish.

### Remaining backlog

| Plan | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 25 (offline) | 25a shipped; 25b queued | 25a in §11 below. |
| 26 (Insta360) | blocked | §3 research required. |

---

## 11. Plan 25a shipped — `feat/academy-360-offline-foundation` (`39bc60a`)

Committed 2026-04-16. Awaiting user merge to `main`. **Migration 181 must run after merge.**

Plan 25 split into 25a (foundation — IndexedDB blob cache, player resolver, per-asset save) shipping now, plus 25b (Service Worker shell cache, full-course batch save, storage manager, enrollment-revocation purge) queued.

### Commit chain update

| Commit | Branch | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `39bc60a` | `feat/academy-360-offline-foundation` | IndexedDB blob cache + save-per-asset + player resolver for 360° |

**Files changed (8 files, +525 / −15 lines):**

- `supabase/migrations/181_offline_assets.sql` (new) — `offline_assets` ledger table. Server tracks what each user has cached; bytes live in the browser.
- `lib/offline/blob-store.ts` (new) — raw IndexedDB wrapper (no `idb` package — school network workaround). `putBlob` / `getBlob` / `deleteBlob` / `listBlobs` / `totalCachedBytes` / `downloadAndCache`. SSR-safe.
- `lib/offline/asset-resolver.ts` (new) — `resolveAssetUrl(url)` returns a `blob:` URL if cached, the original URL otherwise. `releaseResolvedUrl` to revoke on cleanup.
- `app/api/offline/assets/route.ts` (new) — GET list, POST upsert on `(user_id, asset_url)`, DELETE by `{ asset_url }`.
- `components/academy/SaveOfflineButton.tsx` (new) — per-asset toggle with three states: uncached / downloading / cached-with-remove. Pre-flight `navigator.storage.estimate()` quota check hard-refuses below 200 MB free.
- `components/academy/Lesson360VideoPlayer.tsx` — calls `resolveAssetUrl(src)` before PSV init. Plays from blob URL when cached.
- `components/academy/Lesson360PhotoPlayer.tsx` — same resolver integration.
- `app/academy/[courseId]/lessons/[lessonId]/page.tsx` — renders `<SaveOfflineButton>` below the player for 360° lesson types. `dynamic({ ssr: false })` since it touches IndexedDB.

### Behavior delivered

- Every 360° video or photo lesson has a **"Save for offline"** button below the player. Click once → downloads the blob into IndexedDB + registers in the server ledger. Button turns green with a checkmark ("Saved offline") + a trash icon to remove.
- Subsequent visits to that lesson: the player resolves the content URL to the cached blob and streams locally. Works with network disabled.
- Hard-refuse when the browser reports less than 200 MB free so a blown-quota save doesn't leave a half-downloaded blob.
- All error paths toast via `useToast()` (plan 29); all logs structured via `logError()`.

### Plan 25b (queued for next branch)

- **Service Worker** — cache the learner route HTML/JS/CSS so the lesson page itself loads offline (right now only media is cached; the shell still needs network).
- **"Save course for offline"** button on course detail page. Batch-downloads every 360° asset across every lesson in the course.
- **Storage management UI** in account settings — total cached size, per-course breakdown, per-asset list, "clear all offline data" action.
- **Enrollment-revocation purge** — when an enrollment goes inactive (Stripe cancellation, teacher revoke), the next app load reads the user's ledger for that course and deletes the corresponding blobs.
- **iOS Safari validation pass** — real-device test with 50 MB and 150 MB blobs per the plan §11 checklist.

### Merge order

1. Merge `39bc60a` to `main`.
2. Run `psql ... -f supabase/migrations/181_offline_assets.sql`.
3. Open a 360° lesson → click "Save for offline" → confirm green "Saved offline" state.
4. DevTools → Network → Offline → refresh → lesson should still play.
5. DevTools → Application → IndexedDB → `centos-offline` DB should contain the blob keyed by its Cloudinary URL.

### Remaining backlog

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| 25b (offline shell + course save + manager) | next |
| 26 (Insta360 import) | blocked on §3 research |

---

## 12. Plan 25b shipped — `feat/academy-360-offline-manager` (`4f180f1`)

Batch save + storage management. Sits on top of 25a's per-asset plumbing so a learner can save a whole 360° course in one click and see (or reclaim) what's on the device.

**Scope split:** 25b = course-level save + storage manager; **25c (deferred)** = Service Worker shell cache, enrollment-revocation purge, iOS Safari validation pass.

### Files added

- `lib/offline/storage-usage.ts` — merges IndexedDB blob inventory + `/api/offline/assets` ledger into grouped-by-course view. Exposes `getStorageSummary()`, `purgeAsset()`, `purgeCourseGroup()`, and a `formatBytes` helper. Surfaces drift (orphan blobs / orphan ledger) so the UI can offer cleanup.
- `components/academy/offline/OfflineStorageManager.tsx` — learner-facing UI. Per-course sections, per-asset rows with filename + kind + size, per-asset and per-course trash actions. Top card shows `navigator.storage.estimate()` quota with color-coded progress bar (sky/amber/red at 65/85%).
- `app/academy/offline/page.tsx` — hosts the manager at `/academy/offline`.
- `components/academy/offline/SaveCourseOfflineButton.tsx` — course-level batch download. Walks the lesson list sequentially (no parallel — 100+ MB videos would thrash), writes blobs + posts ledger rows, shows progress bar + cancel button. Pre-flight refuses when storage headroom < max(250 MB, 1.25× guess).

### Files modified

- `app/academy/[courseId]/page.tsx` — computes `offlineAssets` (360° + posters) for enrolled, unlocked lessons and renders `<SaveCourseOfflineButton>` next to the curriculum heading. `Lesson` interface gained `content_url` + `video_360_poster_url`.
- `app/academy/my-courses/page.tsx` — "Offline storage" button top-right linking to `/academy/offline`.

### Behavior delivered

- Enrolled learners see **"Save all N lessons for offline"** above the curriculum. Click → sequential download with "Saving lesson X of N — X.Y MB" progress and a cancel button. Cancellation is clean (AbortController + flag) and preserves already-downloaded assets as a resumable partial state.
- When every asset is already cached, the button collapses to a green "All N assets saved offline" pill + "Manage offline storage" link.
- `/academy/offline` shows total cached bytes, browser quota bar, and every cached asset grouped by course (with course titles looked up via `/api/academy/my-courses`). Orphans (blob-without-ledger, ledger-without-blob) call themselves out with an amber banner and can be purged from the same rows.
- `purgeAsset()` + `purgeCourseGroup()` delete from both client IDB and server ledger via `Promise.allSettled` so a single-side failure doesn't wedge the row.
- All errors route through `useToast()` + `logError()` (plan 29).

### Merge order

1. Merge `4f180f1` to `main`.
2. No new migration — reuses 181 (offline_assets) from plan 25a.
3. As enrolled learner: open a course with 360° lessons → click "Save all" → confirm progress bar + eventual green all-cached state.
4. `/academy/offline` → confirm course group shows every cached asset + correct total → click "Remove all" → rows disappear.
5. DevTools → Application → IndexedDB → `centos-offline` → blobs deleted after purge.
6. Quota bar: visible on browsers that implement `navigator.storage.estimate()` (Chromium + recent Safari).

### Plan 25c (deferred follow-ups)

- **Service Worker** for the learner route shell (HTML/JS/CSS) so the page itself loads fully offline — today only media is cached.
- **Enrollment-revocation purge** — when an enrollment goes inactive, next app load reads the user's ledger for that course and deletes the blobs automatically.
- **iOS Safari validation** — real-device test with 50 MB + 150 MB panorama videos per plan 25 §11 checklist.

### Remaining backlog

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| 25c (SW shell + revocation purge + iOS validation) | next |
| 26 (Insta360 import) | blocked on §3 research |

---

## 13. Plan 25c shipped — `feat/academy-360-offline-service-worker` (`a4e12c8`)

Finishes the offline trilogy. Turns out the Service Worker half was already in place from earlier site-wide work, so the substantive new code is the enrollment-revocation purge; iOS validation stays a manual sign-off.

### Pre-existing, confirmed adequate for plan 25c

- `public/sw.js` — `CACHE_VERSION = 'centos-v5'`, handles navigation (network-first with `/offline.html` fallback), static assets (cache-first), and API (stale-while-revalidate). Registered in production by `components/ServiceWorkerRegistration.tsx` from the root layout. No bump needed — the SW has no offline-plan-specific logic that needs updating.
- `public/offline.html` — minimal branded fallback page; copy already makes sense for academy users ("Previously visited pages are still available").

### Files added

- `app/api/offline/assets/purge-revoked/route.ts` — POST endpoint. Server computes the set difference `(user's ledger rows with course_id) ∖ (user's active enrollments)` and deletes those rows. Returns `{ revoked_urls, count }` so the client can mirror the purge into IndexedDB. Trust boundary sits on the server — the ledger is authoritative; the client is untrusted.
- `lib/offline/purge-revoked.ts` — `purgeRevoked()` wraps the endpoint and fans the returned URLs into `deleteBlob(url)` calls via `Promise.allSettled`. Failed local deletes show up later as orphan blobs in the storage manager, which is fine.
- `components/academy/offline/RevokedAssetsPurger.tsx` — invisible mount component. Runs once per SPA session (module-level flag de-dupes across academy navigations), waits 1.5s so it doesn't compete with auth/enrollment mount-time work, and toasts the user when any lessons were removed so the shrink isn't silent.

### Files modified

- `app/academy/layout.tsx` — mounts `<RevokedAssetsPurger />`. Non-academy surfaces keep zero overhead.

### Behavior delivered

- When a teacher revokes a student's enrollment (or a Stripe subscription cancels, or the student unenrolls themselves), the student's next visit to any `/academy/*` page triggers an auto-purge. Ledger rows vanish server-side immediately; matching IndexedDB blobs are deleted client-side a second later.
- User sees a gentle info toast: "Removed N offline lessons from courses you no longer have access to." — no modal, no blocker, just a notice.
- Re-enrolling in the same course after revocation lets them re-save lessons normally. Cache key is the Cloudinary URL, so if the teacher hasn't replaced the media, a fresh save is a no-op download (browser HTTP cache may even serve it instantly).
- Rows with `course_id = null` (posters unlinked from a lesson, stray uploads) are never auto-purged — enrollment gating doesn't apply to them. Users can still purge manually in the storage manager.

### What's NOT in this branch (out of scope for a code-only plan)

- **iOS Safari real-device validation** — `plans/validate/25-academy-360-offline.md §11` already lists the exact checklist (50 MB video, 150 MB video, safari close/reopen, cross-domain navigation). Needs real hardware, sign off after merge.
- **Periodic orphan URL cleanup** — `plan 25 §10`: when a teacher replaces a lesson's `content_url`, the old ledger row becomes orphaned (no lesson references it). Out of scope here — the storage manager already flags these for user cleanup and a background cron is overkill for v1.

### Merge order

1. Merge `a4e12c8` to `main` (depends on `4f180f1` from plan 25b — merge that first if not already).
2. No new migration. Reuses 181 (offline_assets).
3. As enrolled student: save a 360° lesson offline → confirm blob + ledger exist.
4. As admin/teacher: `UPDATE enrollments SET status='cancelled' WHERE user_id=...` for that student's row (or cancel via the teacher UI if it exists).
5. As the student: reload any `/academy/*` page → within ~2 s, see the "Removed N offline lessons…" toast. IndexedDB + ledger should both be empty for that course.
6. Re-enroll → `SaveCourseOfflineButton` appears again and works.

### Remaining backlog

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| 25 iOS validation pass | open — needs device |
| 26 (Insta360 import) | blocked on §3 research |

---

## 14. Plan 26 research brief — `research/academy-insta360-import` (`2ac89b2`)

Not code. Desk research answering three of four §3 questions from [plan 26](../26-academy-insta360-import.md) using public Insta360 documentation and GitHub repos. Brief lives at [plans/26-academy-insta360-import-research.md](../26-academy-insta360-import-research.md).

### Findings at a glance

| §3 question | Answer | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Public SDK / documented file format? | **Yes.** Self-service application, ~3 business day approval. | High |
| 2. Mobile share path from Insta360 app? | **No.** Hardcoded YouTube/Facebook/Street View only; no OS share sheet, no URL scheme. | High |
| 3. NDA or commercial licensing? | No public evidence. Need direct confirmation for commercial SaaS redistribution. | Medium |
| 4. Insta360 dominant among our teachers? | **Unknown — needs survey.** | — |

### What's in the brief

- **Findings for §3.1–§3.3** with source links (insta360.com/developer, onlinemanual.insta360.com, github.com/Insta360Develop).
- **Devrel email draft** — three short questions covering the remaining commercial-terms gap. Ready to paste into a mail client, fill `{Name}`/`{Title}`, and send.
- **Teacher-camera survey** — 5 questions with decision thresholds: >60% Insta360 → pursue full plan 26 (desktop-only); 40–60% → smaller v1 only; <40% → cancel plan 26 proper.
- **Decision tree** mapping survey outcomes to action.

### Key discovery: mobile path is dead

Plan 26 §2 assumed a "Continue in CentenarianOS" deep-link from the Insta360 app's share menu. Insta360's app does not expose an OS share sheet or custom URL scheme — only hardcoded destinations. **Any mobile path requires users to export to Photos/Files first, which is the flow they already have.** If plan 26 proceeds at all, it's desktop-only.

### Key discovery: desktop integration is a native-companion project

The SDK doesn't expose a web/browser runtime. A real integration means shipping a native companion (Electron / Tauri) that uses the C++ CameraSDK to read Insta360 Studio exports and pipe them through our Cloudinary flow. That's a quarter-plus of work we haven't scoped — **if the survey unblocks the plan, we'd need to revisit prioritization before committing.**

### Recommended immediate action

Ship the **§4 smaller v1** (aspect-ratio warn + filename pattern title suggestion) on a separate branch. It's ~1 hour of work, zero external dependencies, valuable regardless of survey outcome. Run the survey and email devrel in parallel.

### Next human actions

1. Send the devrel email drafted in brief §4.
2. Launch the 5-question teacher survey (brief §5).
3. Greenlight the §4 smaller v1 branch independently.

Research phase is complete once the email is sent and the survey is live.

### Remaining backlog (updated)

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| 25 iOS validation pass | open — needs device |
| 26.0 smaller v1 (aspect ratio + filename hints) | ready — ~1 hour |
| 26 full (desktop native companion) | blocked on survey + devrel reply |
| 26 mobile deep-link | **cancelled** — Insta360 app doesn't expose it |

---

## 15. Plan 26.0 shipped — `feat/academy-360-upload-hints` (`6966c6b`)

The research-brief §4 smaller v1. Brand-agnostic upload quality-of-life that doesn't depend on any external research outcome.

### Files added

- `lib/academy/camera-filename.ts` — pattern matcher that recognizes common 360° camera filenames and produces a suggested lesson title:
  - Insta360 X/ONE X video: `VID_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_XX_XXX` → "Insta360 recording — {formatted date}"
  - Insta360 photo: `IMG_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_XX` → "Insta360 photo — {formatted date}"
  - GoPro Max: `GS######` → "GoPro Max recording"
  - Ricoh Theta (new): `R#####` → "Ricoh Theta recording"
  - Ricoh Theta (old, date-based): `yymmddhhmmss` → "Ricoh Theta — {date}"
  - Also exports `checkEquirectangularRatio(width, height)` returning `'ok' | 'suspect' | null` for the 2:1 check.

### Files modified

- `components/academy/Cloudinary360Uploader.tsx` — new `onTitleSuggestion` callback. After a successful upload, inspects `info.width / info.height` and shows a non-blocking amber warning if the ratio isn't in [1.95, 2.05] ("This file is W×H (X.YZ:1). Equirectangular 360° media should be 2:1 — export the stitched version from your camera's desktop app and re-upload."). Parses `info.original_filename` through `suggestTitleFromFilename` and fires the callback when a pattern matches.
- `components/academy/course-editor/CurriculumTab.tsx` — passes `onTitleSuggestion` into all four upload sites (edit/new × video/photo). Handler only applies the suggestion when the current title is empty, so teacher input is never clobbered.

### Why non-blocking on the ratio check

Half-sphere (180° VR180) and partial-sphere content is legitimately not 2:1 but still valuable. Raw dual-fisheye INSV files are 2:1 (two circles side by side) and would pass the ratio check despite being unplayable — so the ratio check alone isn't sufficient to guarantee equirectangular. We warn rather than reject so teachers can self-diagnose the "stretched / frozen preview" failure mode without being blocked when they know what they're doing.

### Verification

1. Open teacher course editor → add new lesson → pick 360 video type.
2. Upload a real Insta360 export (e.g. `VID_20260411_143022_00_012.mp4`). The lesson title should auto-fill "Insta360 recording — {date}" if it was blank; an existing title is preserved.
3. Upload a non-equirectangular file (e.g. a plain 16:9 MP4 — the widget rejects-not-equirectangular formats client-side but if you paste a Cloudinary URL directly, the check would only trigger via the upload path). Amber warning banner appears under the upload button.
4. Type a title first, then upload → title stays as typed.

### Remaining backlog (unchanged from §14 except 26.0 status)

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| 25 iOS validation pass | open — needs device |
| 26.0 smaller v1 | **shipped** (this branch) |
| 26 full (desktop native companion) | blocked on survey + devrel reply |
| 26 mobile deep-link | cancelled |

## 16. Starter tier design — `docs/starter-tier-access-design` (pre-code)

Design artifact, not code. Answers the key question: **how does the app restrict a Starter (pick-3) user to their chosen modules?** Also adds STYLE_GUIDE §5a codifying the "report-per-branch" rule.

Plan source: [plans/future/starter-tier-plan.md](../future/starter-tier-plan.md). This design doc converts it into a concrete access-control architecture before any code lands.

**Pricing (owner-confirmed, 2026-04-16):**
- Monthly: **$5.46/mo** (net $5 after Stripe fees) — env: `STRIPE_STARTER_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID`
- Annual: **$51.80/yr** (net $50 after Stripe fees) — env: `STRIPE_STARTER_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID`
- Annual savings: $65.52 (12 × monthly) − $51.80 = **$13.72/yr, ~21% off**
- Consistent with owner's "price net-of-Stripe-fees" pricing convention for all products.

All prices are **same modules, same gates** — only the billing cadence differs. The Pick-3 constraint applies identically to both.

### 16.1 — The good news: the enforcement primitive already exists

`app/dashboard/layout.tsx:54-102` already implements **exactly** the pattern we need, just under a different name. The "invited user" flow stores an array of allowed route prefixes in `profiles.invite_modules`, and the dashboard layout redirects users hitting a route not in that list. Starter tier is the same mechanism with a different source of truth — we reuse it verbatim.

Current flow for invited users:
1. `/api/auth/me` reads `profiles.invite_modules` and returns it as `inviteModules`.
2. Dashboard layout sets `allowedModules = isInvited && !isPaid && !isAdmin ? inviteModules : null`.
3. Redirect effect: if `allowedModules && !isFreeRoute(pathname)` and the current path isn't in the list, `router.push('/dashboard/planner')`.
4. `components/nav/NavConfig.ts:126-140` exports `getVisibleGroups(isAdmin, allowedModules)` which filters nav items client-side so users never see links to forbidden modules.

**We extend this path, we do not rebuild it.**

### 16.2 — Data model

Single migration (sequential with existing numbering — next available is `182` per [MEMORY.md](../../../.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md) noting `181_offline_assets.sql` was last):

```sql
-- 182_starter_tier.sql
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS selected_modules TEXT[];

-- Drop + re-add the CHECK constraint on subscription_status to allow 'starter'
ALTER TABLE public.profiles DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS profiles_subscription_status_check;
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ADD CONSTRAINT profiles_subscription_status_check
  CHECK (subscription_status IN ('free', 'monthly', 'lifetime', 'starter'));

COMMENT ON COLUMN public.profiles.selected_modules IS
  'Starter-tier users: array of module slugs they picked at checkout (max 3). NULL for all other tiers.';
```

TEXT[] rather than JSONB because we only store a flat array of strings and want Postgres-native array ops (`ANY`, `contains`) if we ever query "which users have module X selected".

### 16.3 — Module → route-prefix mapping

A Starter user picks **3 modules from 8**, but the layout enforces **route prefixes**. Each pickable module maps to one or more top-level dashboard routes. Mapping verified against the actual directory listing in `app/dashboard/`. Sub-routes are included automatically because the layout uses `pathname.startsWith(prefix + '/')`.

**Always-included (for Starter and every other tier) — don't count toward the 3:**

| Route | Reason |
|---|---|
| `/dashboard/planner`, `/dashboard/weekly-review`, `/dashboard/retrospective` | Owner decision 2026-04-16: Planner is universal baseline. |
| `/dashboard/roadmap` | Same — paired with Planner. |
| `/academy` | Decision C: Academy (student) always included; teachers bring content, platform takes fees on paid courses. |
| `/dashboard/categories` | Decision B: Life Categories unrestricted — makes every other module better, doesn't make sense as a separate gate. |
| `/dashboard/data` | Decision A: **full import/export unrestricted**. Users can export their entire data set — including modules they don't currently have access to. This is a data-rights call: locking someone out of their own data on downgrade is hostile. |
| `/dashboard/blog`, `/dashboard/recipes`, `/dashboard/discover`, `/dashboard/billing`, `/dashboard/messages`, `/dashboard/feedback`, `/dashboard/settings`, `/dashboard/teaching` | Existing `FREE_ROUTE_PREFIXES` in `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`. |

**Pickable modules (Starter picks 3 from 8):**

```ts
// lib/access/starter-modules.ts
export type ModuleSlug =
  | 'engine' | 'fuel' | 'metrics' | 'workouts'
  | 'finance' | 'travel' | 'equipment' | 'correlations';

export const STARTER_MODULES: Record<ModuleSlug, {
  label: string;
  prefixes: string[];
  description: string;
  icon: string;
}> = {
  engine:       { label: 'Engine',         prefixes: ['/dashboard/engine'],                               description: 'Focus sessions, analytics, doodle canvas',                    icon: 'Briefcase' },
  fuel:         { label: 'Fuel',           prefixes: ['/dashboard/fuel', '/dashboard/scan'],              description: 'Supplement protocols, daily fuel logs, ingredient scan',      icon: 'Utensils' },
  metrics:      { label: 'Health Metrics', prefixes: ['/dashboard/metrics'],                              description: 'RHR, steps, sleep, body composition, wearable sync',          icon: 'HeartPulse' },
  workouts:     { label: 'Workouts',       prefixes: ['/dashboard/workouts', '/dashboard/exercises'],     description: 'Exercise library, templates, logs, Nomad OS',                 icon: 'Dumbbell' },
  finance:      { label: 'Finance',        prefixes: ['/dashboard/finance'],                              description: 'Transactions, accounts, budgets, invoices, forecast',         icon: 'DollarSign' },
  travel:       { label: 'Travel',         prefixes: ['/dashboard/travel'],                               description: 'Trips, vehicles, fuel logs, maintenance, routes',             icon: 'Navigation' },
  equipment:    { label: 'Equipment',      prefixes: ['/dashboard/equipment', '/dashboard/media'],        description: 'Asset tracking, valuations, media library & gallery',        icon: 'Package' },
  correlations: { label: 'Correlations',   prefixes: ['/dashboard/correlations', '/dashboard/analytics'], description: 'Cross-module analytics, AI insights',                         icon: 'TrendingUp' },
};

export const STARTER_ALWAYS_INCLUDED_PREFIXES = [
  '/dashboard/planner',
  '/dashboard/weekly-review',
  '/dashboard/retrospective',
  '/dashboard/roadmap',
  '/academy',
  '/dashboard/categories',
  '/dashboard/data',
];

export function expandToPrefixes(slugs: string[]): string[] {
  const picked = slugs.flatMap((slug) => STARTER_MODULES[slug as ModuleSlug]?.prefixes ?? []);
  return [...STARTER_ALWAYS_INCLUDED_PREFIXES, ...picked];
}
```

**Bundled decisions (not asking):**
- Scan bundles with Fuel (scan reads ingredients / supplement labels — only useful alongside fuel logging).
- Media library bundles with Equipment (primary consumer — equipment media gallery is the heaviest user).
- Exercises bundles with Workouts (library is the builder surface for workouts).
- Analytics bundles with Correlations (same cross-module analytics surface).

### 16.4 — Enforcement: three layers, one source of truth

Defense-in-depth. Each layer serves a different purpose; they are not redundant.

| Layer | Where | Purpose | Bypass if broken |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Nav filter (UX)** | `NavConfig.getVisibleGroups(isAdmin, allowedPrefixes)` — already supports this signature | Users never see links to modules they can't access. Removes confusion. | User could still type `/dashboard/finance` into the address bar. |
| **2. Dashboard layout redirect (gate)** | `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` existing `useEffect` that redirects invited users — extend the condition to also run for Starter users | Authoritative access gate. Even a user who types the URL directly gets bounced. | Client-only; could theoretically be bypassed with JS disabled, but the APIs still enforce RLS. |
| **3. Dashboard index redirect (fallback)** | `app/dashboard/page.tsx` — when redirecting to default home, land on a selected module if possible | Starter user who'd normally get bounced to `/dashboard/planner` they don't own lands on their first selected module instead. | Cosmetic; layer 2 still catches this. |

**What we deliberately do NOT do:** route-level checks inside each module page. Reason: the dashboard layout already guards the entire dashboard subtree. Scattering access checks across 50+ page.tsx files is a maintenance burden and a footgun (miss one → silent bypass).

**Teaser pages:** when a Starter user tries a forbidden prefix, the layout currently redirects to `/dashboard/planner`. We change that target to a new `/dashboard/upgrade?from=<module>` page that shows:
- "Upgrade to unlock {Module}" headline
- One-click upgrade button (Stripe checkout at Pro / Lifetime price)
- "Or swap a module" link to the module picker

This is a better learner experience than a silent redirect to planner.

### 16.5 — isPaid logic changes

`lib/hooks/useSubscription.ts` currently exports `SubscriptionStatus = 'free' | 'monthly' | 'lifetime'`. Extend:

```ts
export type SubscriptionStatus = 'free' | 'monthly' | 'lifetime' | 'starter';
```

And in `app/dashboard/layout.tsx:47`:

```ts
// Before
const isPaid = subStatus === 'monthly' || subStatus === 'lifetime';

// After
const isPaid = subStatus === 'monthly' || subStatus === 'lifetime' || subStatus === 'starter';
const isStarter = subStatus === 'starter';
// Existing invite logic stays as-is; starter adds a parallel branch.
const allowedModules = isInvited && !isPaid && !isAdmin
  ? inviteModules
  : isStarter && !isAdmin
    ? expandToPrefixes(selectedModules ?? [])
    : null;
```

Admins bypass `allowedModules` entirely (they get the full app regardless of subscription). Lifetime and Monthly users have `allowedModules = null` which unlocks everything.

### 16.6 — Owner decisions (locked in 2026-04-16)

1. **Data Hub (import/export):** **full access, unrestricted.** Owner call — data-rights over product gating. A Starter user can export any data they own, including from modules they no longer have access to. `/dashboard/data` and `/api/*/export` endpoints do not filter by `selected_modules`.
2. **Life Categories:** **unrestricted.** `/dashboard/categories` always included.
3. **Academy (student):** **always included, does not count as 1 of 3.** `/academy` is always accessible. Teachers bring the content; platform revenue comes from fees on paid course enrollments, not from gating student access.
4. **Activity Links across locked modules:** **show + redirect + upgrade CTA.** When a Starter user with Finance (but not Travel) opens an Activity Link picker, Travel entities still appear. Clicking a linked Travel entity redirects to `/dashboard/upgrade?from=travel` which shows the upgrade prompt. Existing links stay visible on source entities (read-only) so the user's prior context isn't lost.

**Additional owner decision:** `/dashboard/planner` and `/dashboard/roadmap` (and the Operate-group sub-tools: weekly-review, retrospective) are **always included for every tier**. They are not part of the 3-picker.

Net effect: Starter picks **3 of 8** modules (Engine, Fuel, Metrics, Workouts, Finance, Travel, Equipment, Correlations). Every other tier gets all of those unrestricted.

### 16.7 — Implementation plan (ordered)

One branch per logical change per STYLE_GUIDE §1. Rough sequencing:

| # | Branch | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `feat/starter-tier-schema` | Migration 182, `SubscriptionStatus` enum, `STARTER_MODULES` map in `lib/access/starter-modules.ts`. No UI changes. |
| 2 | `feat/starter-tier-gating` | Dashboard layout + NavConfig + `/api/auth/me` changes to enforce `allowedModules` for Starter users. Admins tested for regression. |
| 3 | `feat/starter-tier-upgrade-page` | `/dashboard/upgrade` teaser page. Forbidden-module redirects land here. |
| 4 | `feat/starter-tier-module-picker` | Client component on `/pricing` for Starter checkout. Max-3 checkbox grid with descriptions + lock icons. |
| 5 | `feat/starter-tier-stripe` | Both `STRIPE_STARTER_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID` + `STRIPE_STARTER_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID` env vars, checkout route handles `plan=starter-monthly` and `plan=starter-annual` with `selected_modules` metadata, webhook handler writes `subscription_status='starter'` and `profiles.selected_modules`. |
| 6 | `feat/starter-tier-admin-stats` | Admin dashboard: Starter subscriber count + top-3-module-combos widget. |

**Pre-flight gate:** confirm Stripe price creation + env var with owner before branch 5.

### 16.8 — Migration order for merge

1. Land branches in the order above (each PR rebased on the previous if needed).
2. Run `supabase/migrations/182_starter_tier.sql` against production before the branch-5 webhook deployment.
3. Create the Stripe price in dashboard; copy the `price_xxx` into `STRIPE_STARTER_PRICE_ID`.
4. Enable a feature flag `NEXT_PUBLIC_STARTER_TIER_ENABLED=true` (new) on the pricing page so we can stage the rollout.
5. Soft-launch: DM 3 existing free users, walk them through Starter checkout, confirm access behaves as designed.

### 16.9 — Risks + tradeoffs

- **Risk: a Starter user changes their mind and swaps modules, then loses data in a newly-locked module.** Data isn't deleted — only hidden. If they re-select the module later, everything is back. Clarify this in the picker: *"Your data isn't deleted — you can re-select a module anytime."*
- **Tradeoff: Option B (change anytime) from the plan doc wins.** No billing-cycle restriction, no change history. Reason: revenue from Starter is acquisition, not retention-via-lock-in. Friction around swapping modules would tank satisfaction without meaningfully protecting revenue.
- **Risk: cross-app shared DB (see CLAUDE.md).** `selected_modules` column is additive and has no semantic meaning outside CentenarianOS — safe. `subscription_status` gaining `'starter'` is a CHECK constraint change; any other app reading this column will silently ignore unknown values, which is the correct behavior.
- **Risk: feature flag toggled off mid-flight.** If a Starter user is already subscribed when we roll back the flag, they lose access. Mitigation: flag gates the **picker** (checkout path), not the **gating** (already-subscribed users). Users with `subscription_status='starter'` always get their modules regardless of flag state.

### 16.10 — All decisions locked

- ✅ Pricing: $5.46/mo, $51.80/yr (monthly + annual price IDs documented)
- ✅ Access mechanism: extend existing invited-user layer (§16.1, §16.4, §16.5)
- ✅ Data model: migration 182 (§16.2)
- ✅ Module list: 3-from-8 picker + 7 always-included prefixes (§16.3)
- ✅ Four open questions: owner-decided (§16.6)

**No further sign-off needed to open branch 1.** Owner still needs to create the two Stripe prices and share the IDs before branch 5 (Stripe integration) can land — branches 1–4 can proceed without them.

### 16.11 — Ready to code

Next: open `feat/starter-tier-schema` (branch 1 in §16.7), stacked on this design branch.

### Remaining backlog (updated)

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| 25 iOS validation pass | open — needs device |
| 26.0 smaller v1 | shipped |
| 26 full | blocked on survey + devrel reply |
| Starter tier branch 1 | see §17 below |

---

## 17. Starter tier branch 1 shipped — `feat/starter-tier-schema` (pending commit)

Schema + types only. Zero UI, zero behavior changes for existing users. Lays the data-model foundation for branches 2–6 to hang gating and UI off.

### Files added

- `supabase/migrations/182_starter_tier.sql` — adds `profiles.selected_modules TEXT[]` (nullable) and widens the `subscription_status` CHECK to include `'starter'`. Additive — no existing rows need migration, no other app that reads profiles is affected. Column comment documents the pick-3 semantics.
- `lib/access/starter-modules.ts` — the single source of truth for Starter access control. Exports:
  - `ModuleSlug` union of the 8 pickable slugs.
  - `STARTER_PICK_LIMIT = 3`.
  - `STARTER_MODULES` map: each slug → `{ label, prefixes[], description, icon }`. Mirrors §16.3 exactly.
  - `STARTER_ALWAYS_INCLUDED_PREFIXES` array: the 7 paid-tier routes that Starter gets unconditionally (planner family, academy, categories, data).
  - `STARTER_MODULE_SLUGS`, `isModuleSlug`, `expandToPrefixes(slugs)`, `isValidStarterSelection(slugs)` helpers.

### Files modified

- `lib/hooks/useSubscription.ts` — `SubscriptionStatus` gains `'starter'`. `SubscriptionState` gains `selectedModules: string[] | null`. The profile-fetch query selects `selected_modules` and stores it defensively (`Array.isArray(...) ? ... : null`) so a missing column (e.g. during migration rollout) doesn't break the hook.

### Behavior delivered

- **None.** This branch is infrastructure. A user flipping `subscription_status='starter'` directly in the DB would currently get treated as `free` by `isPaid = status === 'monthly' || status === 'lifetime'` (branch 2 changes that). Nothing in the UI exposes the new column.

### Merge order

1. Run `psql ... -f supabase/migrations/182_starter_tier.sql` against the Supabase project.
2. Merge `feat/starter-tier-schema` to `main`.
3. `npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck` before and after — both should return clean (verified in this branch).

### Next branch

Branch 2 — see §18 below.

---

## 18. Starter tier branch 2 shipped — `feat/starter-tier-gating`

Gates. Extends the existing "invited user" access mechanism to cover Starter subscribers. Zero new UI surfaces — just wires the data from branch 1 into the already-built enforcement primitive in `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` and `components/nav/NavConfig.ts`.

### Files modified

- `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`:
  - Imports `expandToPrefixes` from `lib/access/starter-modules.ts`.
  - Reads `selectedModules` from `useSubscription()` (added in branch 1).
  - Extends `isPaid` to include `subStatus === 'starter'`.
  - New `isStarter` boolean derived from `subStatus`.
  - `allowedModules` now resolves as: `null` for admins → `expandToPrefixes(selectedModules)` for Starter → `inviteModules` for invited non-paid non-admin → `null` otherwise.
  - Redirect effect simplified: any user with a non-null `allowedModules` gets redirected off forbidden routes. Single code path covers both Starter and Invited (the two tiers that restrict).

### Files NOT modified (and why)

- `components/nav/NavConfig.ts` — already filters paid items against `allowedModules` with `href === m || href.startsWith(m + '/')`. The existing signature is exactly what Starter users need. Zero changes.
- `app/api/auth/me/route.ts` — subscription data comes through `useSubscription()`, not this endpoint. Keeping the separation: this endpoint is admin/teacher/invited flags; `useSubscription` is subscription tier + selected modules.

### Behavior delivered

- A user with `subscription_status='starter'` and `selected_modules=['finance','workouts','metrics']` can access:
  - All free routes (blog/recipes/billing/messages/feedback/settings/teaching).
  - All always-included paid routes (planner family, academy, categories, data).
  - The three picked module prefixes (finance/*, workouts/* + exercises/*, metrics/*).
  - Every other paid route redirects to `/dashboard/planner` (always-included for Starter, so never loops).
- Nav filters: Starter users don't see links to modules they can't access. Admins + Monthly + Lifetime users see everything (unchanged).
- **Invited-user behavior is unchanged** — the existing `inviteModules` flow still works identically.

### Known edge case (follow-up, not a regression)

A handful of NavConfig entries live under `/dashboard/settings/*` but are marked `paid: true` (e.g., Wearables at `/dashboard/settings/wearables`). The nav filter hides them from Starter/Invited users even when the underlying module is picked (because `/dashboard/settings/wearables` doesn't match any picked prefix). Users can still reach the page by URL because `/dashboard/settings` is in `FREE_ROUTE_PREFIXES`. This is a pre-existing issue that also affected invited users; worth addressing in a NavConfig cleanup branch but out of scope here.

### Merge order

1. Branch 1 (`feat/starter-tier-schema`) must be merged first — this branch depends on `SubscriptionStatus` gaining `'starter'` and `useSubscription` exposing `selectedModules`.
2. Migration 182 must be applied before this branch goes to production (subscription status check rejects 'starter' until it runs).
3. Then merge `feat/starter-tier-gating`.

### Verification

1. Open DB console: `UPDATE profiles SET subscription_status='starter', selected_modules=ARRAY['finance','workouts','metrics'] WHERE id='<your-user-id>';`
2. Refresh dashboard: nav shows only Finance, Workouts, Metrics paid items plus always-included (Planner family, Academy, Categories, Data).
3. Type `/dashboard/travel` → redirects to `/dashboard/planner`.
4. Type `/dashboard/finance` → loads normally.
5. `UPDATE` back to `'free'` → user is kicked to `/pricing`.
6. `UPDATE` to `'monthly'` → full access restored, no restrictions.

### Next branch

Branch 3 — `feat/starter-tier-upgrade-page`. Replaces the redirect target from `/dashboard/planner` to a new `/dashboard/upgrade?from=<module>` page with upgrade CTAs (Monthly / Annual / Lifetime). Same gate, friendlier UX.

### Remaining backlog (updated with plans 30 + 31)

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| 25 iOS validation pass | open — needs device |
| 26.0 smaller v1 | shipped |
| 26 full | blocked on survey + devrel reply |
| **30: Stripe fee calculator** | **new** — see `plans/30-stripe-fee-calculator.md`. Small component, shows live "You receive $X after fees" on every price input. Est ~1–2 hrs. Added per owner request 2026-04-16. |
| **31: i18n (EN + ES) + SEO metadata** | **new** — see `plans/31-i18n-en-es-plus-seo.md`. Phased: Phase 1 infra + pricing/home (1 day), Phase 2 public surfaces (3–5 days), Phase 3 authenticated app (5 days), Phase 4 errors/emails/legal (1–2 days). Added per owner request 2026-04-16. |
| Starter tier branch 3 | next — `/dashboard/upgrade?from=X` page |
| Starter tier branch 4 | pending — module picker on `/pricing` |
| Starter tier branch 5 | pending — Stripe checkout + webhook (needs price IDs) |
| Starter tier branch 6 | pending — admin stats |

---

## 19. Starter tier branch 3 shipped — `feat/starter-tier-upgrade-page`

Better UX for the gate from branch 2. A Starter user hitting a forbidden route now lands on a personalized upgrade page instead of being silently redirected to `/dashboard/planner`.

### Files added

- `app/dashboard/upgrade/page.tsx` — client component with a `Suspense` wrapper for `useSearchParams`. Reads `?from=<moduleSlug>`, validates against `isModuleSlug`, and:
  - Personalizes the headline ("Unlock Travel" vs. generic "Upgrade your plan" for direct hits).
  - Renders a chip row of the Starter user's current picks (if they have any).
  - Shows three CTA cards: **Swap a module** (→ `/pricing?action=swap`, branch 4 handles), **Pro Monthly** ($10.60/mo via existing `/api/stripe/checkout`), **Lifetime** ($103.29 via same endpoint).
  - Footer reassurance: "A locked module's data is hidden, not deleted — re-select it anytime and everything is back."

### Files modified

- `lib/access/starter-modules.ts` — new `pathToModuleSlug(pathname)` reverse-lookup helper. Scans `STARTER_MODULES` for a prefix match and returns the slug, or `null` if the path doesn't belong to any pickable module. Used by the layout redirect to build the `?from=` query.
- `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`:
  - Adds `/dashboard/upgrade` to `FREE_ROUTE_PREFIXES` (must be reachable by every authenticated tier; otherwise a Starter user would loop trying to reach the upgrade page).
  - Redirect effect now forks by tier: **Starter** → `/dashboard/upgrade?from=<slug>` (or `/dashboard/upgrade` when the slug can't be resolved). **Invited** → `/dashboard/planner` (their flow isn't part of the Starter funnel; their allowed_modules are free-text prefixes, not module slugs — reusing the upgrade page would show wrong copy).

### Behavior delivered

- Starter user picks Finance + Workouts + Metrics, clicks a `/dashboard/travel/trips/new` link → redirected to `/dashboard/upgrade?from=travel`. Page reads "Unlock Travel. Trips, vehicles, fuel logs, maintenance, routes. It's not one of your picked Starter modules — choose a path below." Current picks shown as chips. Three CTAs.
- Direct navigation to `/dashboard/upgrade` (no query param) shows generic "Upgrade your plan" copy. Still useful.
- Pro and Lifetime buttons fire the same `/api/stripe/checkout` endpoint the pricing page uses — no new infrastructure.
- Swap button routes to `/pricing?action=swap` (branch 4 will read this query param and scroll to the module picker).

### Merge order

1. Branches 1 + 2 must be merged first.
2. Migration 182 applied in prod.
3. Merge `feat/starter-tier-upgrade-page`.
4. No new migrations, no new env vars.

### Verification

1. Set your user to Starter with three picks (see §18 verification SQL).
2. Type `/dashboard/travel` → should land on `/dashboard/upgrade?from=travel` with personalized copy.
3. Type `/dashboard/upgrade` directly → generic copy, same three CTAs.
4. Click "Pro — all modules" → Stripe checkout opens for Monthly plan.
5. Click "Swap a module" → navigates to `/pricing?action=swap` (picker arrives in branch 4).
6. Revert to `'monthly'` → `/dashboard/upgrade` is still reachable directly (no redirect loop since `allowedModules === null` for Monthly tier).

### Next branch

Branch 4 — see §20 below.

---

## 20. Starter tier branch 4 shipped — `feat/starter-tier-module-picker`

The picker that was referenced by branches 2 + 3 as "TBD". New Starter-tier visual + flow on the pricing page, and the live swap path for existing subscribers. New-subscription checkout is wired to the expected API contract; branch 5 adds the backend half.

### Files added

- `components/pricing/StarterModulePicker.tsx` — presentational picker. Props: `mode` (`'new' | 'swap'`), `initialSelection`, `initialCadence`, `onSubmit`, `onCancel`, `externalError`. Internal state for picked set (max 3 enforced with friendly error when user hits cap), billing cadence, submitting flag. Renders 8 checkbox cards in a 2-col grid with per-module icons from the Lucide map, a live `X / 3` counter, a monthly/annual cadence toggle (hidden in swap mode — cadence changes go through Stripe's customer portal), and a fuchsia Continue button that resolves its label from cadence and mode.
- `app/api/user/starter-modules/route.ts` — `PATCH` endpoint. Enforces: auth, `isValidStarterSelection` (exactly 3 unique valid slugs), `subscription_status='starter'` (only Starter tier can set this column — Lifetime/Monthly aren't module-gated). Uses the service-role client after the explicit auth check.

### Files modified

- `app/pricing/page.tsx`:
  - New state `pickerMode: 'new' | 'swap' | null` + `pickerError`.
  - Reads subscription via `useSubscription()` to know current tier + current picks.
  - `SwapActionTrigger` child (Suspense-wrapped) reads `?action=swap` query from `/dashboard/upgrade`'s swap button and auto-opens the modal in swap mode; immediately strips the query via `router.replace` so refresh doesn't reopen.
  - New `handleStarterSubmit(slugs, cadence)` forks by mode: swap → PATCH; new → POST `/api/stripe/checkout` with `plan: 'starter-monthly' | 'starter-annual'` and `selected_modules` metadata. Auth failures open the `PurchaseModal` as with existing plans.
  - Grid layout: `md:grid-cols-2 max-w-3xl` → `md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 max-w-6xl`. Starter card is leftmost; Monthly (Popular) middle; Lifetime (Best Value) right.
  - Starter card: "Start Small" badge, $5.46/mo price + "or $51.80/year (save 21%)" secondary line, five feature bullets focused on flexibility. CTA text forks by subscription: existing Starter subscribers see "Change your 3 modules" (opens swap mode); everyone else sees "Pick my 3 modules" (opens new mode).
  - Modal mount at the end wraps `<StarterModulePicker>` with the shared `Modal` component (size lg).

### Behavior delivered

- **New signup path:** visitor clicks "Pick my 3 modules" → modal opens → visitor toggles cadence + picks 3 → Continue → `/api/stripe/checkout` fires with the Starter plan slug. Branch 5 must implement the backend handler for this request; until then, the response will 400 and the picker surfaces "Starter checkout is coming soon" via `externalError`. The picker UI is fully usable for validation.
- **Swap path (fully live):** existing Starter user on `/dashboard/upgrade` clicks "Swap a module" → lands on `/pricing?action=swap` → picker auto-opens in swap mode pre-populated with their current 3 picks → they change one → Continue → PATCH `/api/user/starter-modules` → subscription hook refreshes → modal closes → nav visibility updates within the same render cycle because layout reads from `useSubscription()`.
- **Edge cases handled:** trying to check a 4th module surfaces the "uncheck one to swap" message; canceling the modal resets state; submitting with <3 picks shows validation error; not-logged-in visitors hit the existing `PurchaseModal` auth flow on Continue.

### Swap-path accessibility notes

- Cadence toggle uses `<fieldset>` + `<legend className="sr-only">` + radio inputs hidden via `sr-only` with styled labels. Screen readers announce the group and current selection. Keyboard nav works via Tab + arrow keys (browser default for radios in a fieldset).
- Live counter has `aria-live="polite"` so screen readers announce the updated count on each pick.
- Each module card's label wraps the input with `aria-describedby` pointing at the description span — screen readers read label + description together.

### Merge order

1. Branches 1 + 2 + 3 must be merged first.
2. Migration 182 applied in prod.
3. Merge `feat/starter-tier-module-picker`.
4. No new env vars yet (those come with branch 5).

### Verification

1. Fresh Incognito session → visit `/pricing` → Starter card renders with "Start Small" badge, "Pick my 3 modules" CTA.
2. Click CTA → modal opens, 8 module cards in 2×4 grid, cadence toggle shows Monthly/Annual.
3. Pick 3 → Continue label becomes "Continue — $5.46/mo" → click → expect 400 until branch 5, friendly error visible in picker.
4. Toggle cadence to Annual → label changes to "Continue — $51.80/yr".
5. Log in as existing Starter user (seeded per §18 verification SQL) → pricing Starter card reads "Change your 3 modules".
6. Click → modal opens in swap mode, current 3 picks pre-checked, no cadence toggle.
7. Uncheck one + check another → Continue → PATCH fires → modal closes → reload page → picker reopened in swap mode shows the new selection.
8. Hit `/pricing?action=swap` directly (matches the `/dashboard/upgrade` swap button) → picker auto-opens in swap mode → URL updates to `/pricing` (no refresh loop).

### Next branch

Branch 5 — see §21 below.

---

## 21. Starter tier branch 5 shipped — `feat/starter-tier-stripe`

Wires the backend half of what branch 4's picker was already calling. End-to-end Starter signup now works: visitor picks 3 modules → Stripe checkout → webhook writes `subscription_status='starter'` + `selected_modules` → dashboard layout immediately gates correctly. Also handles the downgrade path (subscription cancellation clears `selected_modules` to keep the schema invariant).

### Env vars required (already set by owner in Vercel + `.env.local`)

- `STRIPE_STARTER_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID` — $5.46/mo recurring price
- `STRIPE_STARTER_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID` — $51.80/yr recurring price

### Files modified

- `app/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts`:
  - `VALID_PLANS` gains `'starter-monthly'`, `'starter-annual'`.
  - Body destructures `selected_modules` alongside `plan`. For Starter plans, validates with `isValidStarterSelection` before doing any Stripe work.
  - Two new guard clauses: block Starter checkout when user is already `'monthly'` ("cancel Monthly first") or `'starter'` ("use the picker to swap"). Lifetime block unchanged.
  - New Starter branch creates the checkout session with the resolved price ID, serializes the 3 slugs as a comma-joined string in metadata (Stripe metadata values are strings ≤500 chars; 3 slugs fit trivially), and stamps the same metadata on the subscription via `subscription_data.metadata` so downstream subscription events can route without re-fetching the session.
- `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`:
  - New `parseSelectedModules(csv)` helper deserializes the CSV metadata and re-validates with `isValidStarterSelection` — defensive against truncation or manipulation.
  - New Starter branch in the `checkout.session.completed` switch: retrieves the subscription to get `current_period_end`, writes `subscription_status='starter'` + `selected_modules` + subscription id + expiry to `profiles`.
  - `customer.subscription.deleted` handler now clears `selected_modules` alongside the downgrade to `'free'`. Maintains the invariant "`selected_modules IS NULL` iff `subscription_status <> 'starter'`". Also implicitly arms plan 25c's revocation purger for any offline content tied to courses the downgraded user was enrolled in.
- `app/api/stripe/sync/route.ts`:
  - New Starter branch mirrors the webhook behavior for the billing-page-redirect fallback. Same CSV parse, same validation, same DB write. Returns `{ status: 'starter' }` on success.

### Behavior delivered — end-to-end Starter signup

1. Visitor lands on `/pricing`, clicks "Pick my 3 modules" → modal opens.
2. Picks 3 modules + cadence, clicks "Continue — $5.46/mo" (or annual).
3. Frontend POSTs `/api/stripe/checkout` with `{ plan: 'starter-monthly', selected_modules: ['finance','workouts','metrics'] }`.
4. Checkout route validates, creates customer if missing, creates session with the Starter price, stamps metadata on session + subscription, returns the URL.
5. Browser redirects to Stripe's hosted checkout.
6. Visitor completes payment.
7. Stripe fires `checkout.session.completed` → webhook parses `selected_modules` metadata, writes profile row.
8. Browser lands on `/dashboard/billing?success=true&session_id=cs_xxx`.
9. Billing page calls `/api/stripe/sync` as a safety net in case the webhook is delayed — idempotent; writes the same row if not already written.
10. User refreshes any dashboard page — `useSubscription()` reads `subscription_status='starter'` + `selected_modules`, dashboard layout gates accordingly, nav shows only picked + always-included items.

### Behavior delivered — downgrade

- User cancels via Stripe customer portal or billing page.
- Stripe fires `customer.subscription.deleted`.
- Webhook downgrades to `'free'` and clears `selected_modules`.
- User's next dashboard load: `hasAccess=false` (because `subStatus='free'`, not admin, not invited) → redirect to `/pricing`.
- Plan 25c's `RevokedAssetsPurger` runs on the next `/academy/*` visit → deletes any offline-cached lessons tied to courses the user was enrolled in via Starter.

### Merge order

1. Branches 1–4 merged.
2. Migration 182 applied.
3. **Owner: create two Stripe products / prices** (done per user confirmation 2026-04-16):
   - Starter Monthly — $5.46 USD recurring monthly
   - Starter Annual — $51.80 USD recurring yearly
4. **Owner: set env vars** `STRIPE_STARTER_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID` and `STRIPE_STARTER_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID` with the `price_xxx` values (done per user confirmation 2026-04-16).
5. Merge `feat/starter-tier-stripe`.

### Verification

1. `/pricing` → Starter card → "Pick my 3 modules" → pick 3 → Continue Monthly → real Stripe checkout loads (use Stripe test mode + card `4242 4242 4242 4242`).
2. Complete checkout → redirect to `/dashboard/billing?success=true&session_id=...`.
3. Inspect `profiles` row: `subscription_status='starter'`, `selected_modules` array matches picks, `stripe_subscription_id` populated, `subscription_expires_at` ~1 month out (or ~1 year for annual).
4. Navigate dashboard: only picked + always-included items in nav. `/dashboard/travel` (if not picked) → `/dashboard/upgrade?from=travel`.
5. From Stripe dashboard or billing page: cancel subscription → within seconds webhook fires → `profiles` row reverts to `'free'` with `selected_modules=null` → user is bounced to `/pricing`.
6. Try Starter checkout while already `'monthly'` → 400 with "Cancel your Monthly plan first".
7. Try Starter checkout while already `'starter'` → 400 with "use the module picker to swap".

### Next branch

Branch 6 — see §22 below.

---

## 22. Starter tier branch 6 shipped — `feat/starter-tier-admin-stats`

Final branch in the Starter-tier series. Adds visibility so the owner can watch Starter adoption and tune the module list based on actual picks.

### Files modified

- `app/api/admin/stats/route.ts`:
  - Imports `STARTER_MODULE_SLUGS` + `STARTER_MODULES` from the access-control lib so the API is the one source of truth for module labels.
  - Adds `starter` count alongside `free`/`monthly`/`lifetime` in the existing tier tally.
  - New per-user fetch of `selected_modules` scoped to `subscription_status='starter'` — small dataset, one round trip.
  - Computes `modulePopularity` (count + percentage per slug, sorted desc) and `topCombos` (top 5 3-module combinations, canonicalized by sorted-slug join so order-independent combinations are counted as the same combo).
  - `revenue.monthlyMRR` now includes `starter * 5.46` as a floor (annual subscribers contribute more because the $51.80 pre-pay offsets ~12 months of MRR accrual — we underreport monthly burn rate rather than overreport).
  - New `starter` response block: `{ total, modulePopularity, topCombos, estimatedMrrFloor }`. Rounded to 2 decimals.
- `app/admin/page.tsx`:
  - `Stats` interface extended with `starter` block and `users.starter`.
  - Top users grid widens from 4 to 5 columns on desktop to fit the new Starter card (Sparkles icon, sky color to match the pricing page Starter card).
  - New "Starter tier breakdown" section renders conditionally — only when `stats.starter.total > 0` so the overview stays clean before any Starter adoption.
  - Two cards inside the breakdown section:
    - **Module popularity:** progress-bar list with label + count + percentage, accessible via `role="progressbar"` + `aria-valuenow`.
    - **Top module combos:** ranked ordered list (1–5) showing the combo and the subscriber count.

### Behavior delivered

- Before Starter has any subscribers: admin overview shows the new Starter card with `0` and no breakdown section.
- After the first Starter signup: breakdown section appears, module popularity shows 100% for the three picked modules and 0% for the rest, combo #1 is that single user's picks.
- As adoption grows: owner can see at a glance which modules are being picked ("Finance is in 80% of Starter carts — we're not going to kill it") and which 3-module combinations cluster ("Finance + Workouts + Metrics is the dominant combo — maybe we should offer a 'Health + Money' preset").

### Merge order

1. Branches 1–5 merged.
2. Migration 182 applied.
3. Merge `feat/starter-tier-admin-stats`. No new env vars, no new migrations.

### Verification

1. As admin, visit `/admin` → `Starter ($5.46)` card shows current count.
2. With ≥1 active Starter subscriber (from branch 5 verification steps), Starter tier breakdown section appears.
3. Module popularity list is sorted with most-picked at top; percentages sum to ~300% when everyone picks exactly 3.
4. Top combos list groups users by canonical sorted-slug key — pick `['finance','workouts','metrics']` and a second user picks `['workouts','metrics','finance']` and they should count as the same combo.

### Starter tier series — done

Branches 1–6 ship a complete Pick-3-modules paid tier. Remaining work for the Starter tier is all operational (Stripe dashboard monitoring, customer support for swap questions) rather than engineering.

### Remaining backlog

| Plan | Status |
|---|---|
| 25 iOS validation pass | open — needs device |
| 26.0 smaller v1 | shipped |
| 26 full | blocked on survey + devrel reply |
| 30 Stripe fee calculator | ready — ~1–2 hrs |
| 31 i18n EN+ES + SEO | phased, 1–2 weeks |
| 32 admin email verification dashboard | shipped (this series, §23) |
| Starter tier | **fully shipped** (branches 1–6) |

---

## 23. Admin email verification — `feat/admin-email-verification`

Plan 32 shipped in one branch. Admin can see who hasn't verified and nudge them.

### Files added

- `plans/32-admin-email-verification.md` — plan doc with scope, API shapes, and verification checklist.
- `app/api/admin/users/[id]/resend-verification/route.ts` — POST endpoint. Admin-gated. Fetches the auth user by id, short-circuits when already verified, otherwise calls `auth.admin.generateLink({ type: 'magiclink', email })`. Magic link (not signup) because the target user already exists; clicking it both logs them in and confirms their email as a side effect.
- `app/api/admin/users/resend-all-unverified/route.ts` — POST endpoint. Admin-gated. Lists all auth users, filters to `!email_confirmed_at`, caps at 100 per call (returns 413 with a clear error above that), runs `generateLink` sequentially to respect Supabase's per-email rate limits. Returns `{ attempted, succeeded, failed, alreadyVerified, skippedMissingEmail }`.

### Files modified

- `app/api/admin/users/route.ts` — response rows now include `email_confirmed_at: string | null` drawn from `db.auth.admin.listUsers()`.
- `app/admin/users/page.tsx`:
  - `UserRow` gains `email_confirmed_at` + the `starter` status value.
  - New `Verified` column between `Email / Username` and `Plan`. Green checkmark with tooltip for verified users; amber `Resend` button (with `Mail` icon, `MailX` when no email on file, spinning loader while sending) for unverified.
  - New filter pill `✉ Unverified`. Also accepts `?filter=unverified` via URL.
  - New `starter` filter pill (was missing — needed for the pricing page to round-trip search URLs).
  - Header gains a `Resend to all unverified` button (only when ≥1 unverified user exists) with a confirmation modal before firing.
  - `STATUS_BADGE` map gains `starter: 'bg-sky-900/50 text-sky-300'`.
  - Summary line under the page title calls out the unverified count in amber.
  - Reload after per-row send (in case the user was already verified — toast explains).

### Behavior delivered

- Admin visits `/admin/users` — every row has a Verified cell. Header shows "X unverified" if any. Top-right shows a bulk resend button when there are unverified users.
- Filter by `✉ Unverified` — table collapses to the unverified subset.
- Click per-row `Resend` — toast "Verification email sent to foo@bar.com" (or "already verified — no email sent" if the status is stale). No refresh needed; users page reloads automatically to sync.
- Click `Resend to all unverified` — confirmation modal shows the count. Confirm → toast with the success/failure/skip breakdown.
- Over 100 unverified: the bulk endpoint returns 413 with a helpful message; admin should filter and resend per-row, or call again (each call processes the first 100 it sees).

### Merge order

1. Merge `feat/admin-email-verification`. No migrations, no new env vars.
2. Standalone feature — doesn't depend on the Starter-tier series and can land before or after those.

### Verification

1. DB inspect: an unverified user has `auth.users.email_confirmed_at = NULL`.
2. Admin `/admin/users` → their row shows the amber `Resend` button.
3. Click → toast success → check inbox (or Supabase dashboard → Auth → Logs) for the magic link.
4. Filter by `✉ Unverified` → only unverified users remain.
5. Click `Resend to all unverified` → modal → confirm → expect one email per unverified user.
6. As the user, click the magic link → log in + `email_confirmed_at` populated → admin sees green checkmark after reload.

## 24. Bug backlog (owner-reported 2026-04-16)

Not plans, just captured bugs. Each needs its own branch when worked on.

### 24.1 — "Recipe Ideas" button fixed (shipped in `feat/ai-recipe-generator`)

Owner decision 2026-04-16: option C — route to an AI recipe generator, with a secondary link to the public recipes hub.

**Surprise finding:** the full AI generator already existed at [app/dashboard/fuel/recipe-ideas/page.tsx](../../app/dashboard/fuel/recipe-ideas/page.tsx) with a live `/api/ai/recipe-ideas` Gemini-powered endpoint. The Fuel-page button had just been left pointing at `/tech-roadmap` with a `coming soon` flag. Zero new implementation needed — only wiring.

**Changes:**
- [app/dashboard/fuel/page.tsx](../../app/dashboard/fuel/page.tsx): Recipe Ideas card `href` → `/dashboard/fuel/recipe-ideas`, dropped the `comingSoon` flag and its UI branches (no other module used it).
- [app/dashboard/fuel/recipe-ideas/page.tsx](../../app/dashboard/fuel/recipe-ideas/page.tsx): header now has a secondary "Browse recipes" CTA linking to `/recipes` (the public hub) alongside the primary "Generate Ideas" button. Satisfies owner request for the public-hub link.

Bug closed.

### 24.2 — Finance scanner uses `/dashboard/scan` (shipped in `bug/finance-use-shared-scanner`)

Finance page was using the shared `ScanButton` component inline — captured receipt, pre-filled the Add Transaction modal with extracted fields (amount, vendor, date, line-item description). Simple but minimal.

`/dashboard/scan` has the richer flow: auto-routing (receipt → finance, recipe → recipes, maintenance → travel), ScanResultRouter for reviewing + editing extracted fields, line-item price history recording, receipt_line_items persistence, and contact attachment. Owner's assessment of "better UI/UX" tracks.

**Changes in [app/dashboard/finance/page.tsx](../../app/dashboard/finance/page.tsx):**
- Removed `ScanButton` + `ScanResult` + `ReceiptExtraction` imports.
- Removed `handleScanResult` handler (no longer needed — the scan page creates the transaction directly and links to the transaction detail page).
- Replaced the inline `<ScanButton>` with a `<Link href="/dashboard/scan">` styled identically (same purple button + ScanLine icon).

Transaction creation path now:
1. User on `/dashboard/finance` clicks "Scan Receipt" → routes to `/dashboard/scan`.
2. Capture/upload → Gemini OCR → `ScanResultRouter` preview.
3. Confirm → `/api/finance/transactions` POST + line item price records + receipt_line_items + source linking.
4. Success state links back to `/dashboard/finance/transactions/{id}` for review.

Bug closed.

### 24.3 — Checkmarks on landing pages + tech roadmap are broken

User-reported visual regression. Need screenshots or at least the specific URLs to reproduce. Probably a CSS class change that affected icon rendering (e.g. Tailwind v4 migration artifact). Quick to fix once reproduced.

**Branch name when ready:** `bug/landing-checkmark-icons`.
